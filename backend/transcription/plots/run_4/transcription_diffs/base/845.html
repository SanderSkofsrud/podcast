            <p><span class="replace">a quick warning there are curse words that are unbeaped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beeped version you can find that at our website thisamericanlifeorg okay</span> this isn't news to anybody our country is profoundly cataclysmically divided disagreeing about so many basic things the covid vaccine was the last election stolen was january <span class="replace">6th and</span> insurrection <span class="replace">whereas</span> they called it <span class="replace">a</span> tucker <span class="replace">carlson</span> show a grandma selfie party it's two different visions of reality that seem doomed to never reconcile and maybe this is an inappropriate comparison but somehow this comes to mind for me you know that thing in your personal life where you get into a serious fight with somebody who you really care about and they see it one way and you see it another way and you're not seeing eye to eye the best outcome the thing you hope for is that by talking it through and really listening to each other and trying to sort it out in the end you'll either <span class="insert">they're</span> see <span class="replace">at</span> the same way you'll have the same story or this is almost as good you won't agree on what happened but at least you'll get where the other person's coming from and they'll get where you're coming from and neither of you thinks the <span class="replace">other's</span> crazy or has <span class="replace">they'll</span> intent i just wish we could do that with our politics i understand all the reasons why that's not happening i understand how some people think <span class="replace">but</span> way beyond that it's impossible counterproductive just a bad idea <span class="delete">but</span> just to say i wish i think lots of us wish that without that and divided so evenly nobody can predict the outcome of a presidential election without that how are we going to keep functioning as a country but <span class="replace">who's</span> trying to bridge that gap between red america and blue america <span class="delete">and</span> bring us to a common story i honestly can't name a half dozen people if i try and so whenever i hear of anybody attempting to do anything like that and doing what seems like a decent job of it i perk up and i heard about somebody like that recently from somebody <span class="delete">who</span> used to work here at our show <span class="insert">brian reed</span> they did a story on this new podcast that he started with another former this american life producer <span class="replace">robin semyon robin</span> produces the show brian <span class="replace">hose said</span> and they did a story about somebody doing this and brian knows how i have kind of a <span class="replace">b me a</span> bonnet about this particular thing and so he sent me a copy and i am very excited to present a version of their story for you right now because it gave me a glimpse <span class="insert">like</span> a very tentative first step kind of glimpse and i know that's a mixed metaphor but just whatever a first step glimpse of the possibility that people in this country could listen to each other a little bit and look at the facts of something together and understand each other just maybe a little smudge better we have some other stories in today's program <span class="replace">they are</span> about couples managing their feelings during this heightened political moment on the verge of all of us getting one president or another one future or another we're <span class="replace">gonna</span> get to all that after the break from wbez chicago <span class="replace">to samaritan gif</span> i'm <span class="insert">eric glass</span> stay with us <span class="replace">it's american life at</span> one a tiny thing that gives me hope <span class="replace">okay</span> so like i said before the break this is a story about somebody trying to bridge the gap in the way that red america and blue america see the world and like i said it comes from this new podcast that <span class="insert">brian reed</span> is hosting called question everything it's a podcast about journalism and the person trying to bridge the gap between the two americas <span class="replace">and the</span> story is <span class="delete">a</span> journalist in the story that they did on the podcast they get to that guy in a little bit <span class="delete">but</span> the story starts with a couple <span class="replace">dicken</span> emily who found themselves <span class="replace">unhappy</span> living on opposite sides of the <span class="replace">red blue</span> divide when <span class="replace">the</span> first met decades ago <span class="replace">here's</span> a republican she was she says a bleeding heart liberal but it wasn't a big deal <span class="insert">so</span> then that changed here's brian with one of the producers of question everything <span class="insert">zach st gois</span> so zach you're the one who's gotten to know <span class="replace">the canemalee</span> this couple that was fighting over the news right yeah so their names are richard and <span class="insert">emily newton</span> he obviously goes by dick they're in their 70s they just celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary <span class="replace">to</span> second marriage <span class="delete">for</span> both of them they fell in love singing hymns together in the choir at church she's <span class="replace">in</span> alto he's a bass that's sweet where do they live <span class="delete">they live in orange</span> county california <span class="replace">okay</span> and over the last several years <span class="replace">they</span> found that they've been growing more and more miserable over something that seems so basic which is what news they would each want to read in the morning we get up and get a cup of coffee and we sit down and we start going through our emails and we sit next to each other when we're doing that i'd say emily i have an article here would you be interested in me sending it to you and she would say who's it from and if i said <span class="replace">breibert</span> news or breitbart is that what you mean breitbart that's it yeah breitbart or <span class="replace">epic</span> times she knew those were really <span class="replace">right leaning</span> and wasn't really interested i was the same way with her <span class="delete">if</span> she found something on atlantic or new york times or washington post <span class="replace">yeah that</span> doesn't trust anything no matter what it <span class="replace">does</span> that comes from the new york times <span class="replace">and</span> washington post the atlantic the atlantic <span class="delete">msnbc cnn that's another one cnn is another one it doesn't matter what they're saying he just automatically dismisses well they've developed their own reputation ok i realized we are not reading from the same hymnal here</span> so they told me that they started arguing a lot more when trump came on the political scene dick supported trump emily furiously did not but then it was after election day in 2020 when they had one of their biggest disagreements from the beginning i never believed that the election was fraudulently stolen i have more faith in people and in our democracy dick was more open to doubt they were saying that there was a lot of things that were going on that shouldn't have been going on there was packing drop boxes with ballots one person would walk up to the ballot box and drop in all kinds of ballots into it so this particular theory dick's talking about it's from a movie one of the many sources that he was turning to at the time it's called 2000 mules have you heard of it i've heard of it yes i've had people talk to me about it as i've been reporting basically yeah so this movie 2000 mules it looks like a documentary but it's really a propaganda film it's about a stolen election theory it's not true but for a while on the right this movie seemed like it was everywhere everyone seemed to be talking about it trump actually did a screening of it at maralago it was in something like 400 movie theaters i mean lots and lots of people believed it it's made by <span class="replace">dennis jussuzah</span> he's a rightwing political commentator all right <span class="delete">and</span> what's the gist the gist is that it's about this theory that a bunch of democratic groups were paying people who they call mules to illegally collect ballots and stuff them into ballot boxes in key swing states <span class="delete">man</span> philadelphia <span class="replace">along</span> we've identified more than 1100 mules so there <span class="replace">are</span> these talking head interviews and <span class="replace">their</span> intercut with this grainy surveillance footage that shows <span class="insert">like</span> this person <span class="insert">like</span> putting ballots into a box and they're like see there's all the evidence you need but that's not real surveillance footage or it is real surveillance footage but it's showing people just dropping off ballots legally and there's scary music under it there's scary music scary <span class="replace">voice over</span> we are not a democracy we are a criminal cartel masquerading as a democracy and when dick watched it like a lot of people he thought it seemed really plausible it just added to the other stories that i was hearing things that were happening in arizona and georgia i'm thinking yeah there's stuff going on here that shouldn't be going on so dick is watching this movie he's reading his sources and there are so many sources that cite so many stories about election fraud which is part of what made it so believable and also he's watching the president president trump say over and over again that the election was fraudulent <span class="replace">and</span> had been stolen from him yes exactly and then emily's consuming all of her own sources and they say the exact opposite and it all added to this feeling that it wasn't safe for them to talk about politics <span class="delete">zach st louis</span> did that feel different from other arguments or disagreements you'd had about nonpolitical things over your marriage it did because there was no give and take we can argue about what we're going to spend our money on <span class="delete">and</span> we can argue about our kids <span class="insert">you know</span> we can argue about the neighborhood but we usually come to some sort of resolution this whole thing about trump <span class="replace">there's</span> no resolution <span class="delete">zach st louis</span> how did that feel frustrating because i know my husband i know what a smart sensitive thoughtful person he is <span class="insert">because</span> he's very generous i know all that about him and to have him suddenly be aligned to this person who i found absolutely <span class="replace">disticable</span> was very troubling she wouldn't talk to me she basically just i don't <span class="replace">wanna</span> talk about it i would try but it <span class="insert">just it</span> wasn't <span class="replace">gonna</span> happen and if it did we'd end up yelling at each other i got so angry with her one day that i finally i just had to walk out of the house and walk down the street to cool off and then i started thinking wow i'm letting politics get involved in our marriage because i was really angry at the time and i just couldn't stand that i never thought that politics was important enough to jeopardize what she and i had together <span class="delete">zach st louis</span> did you feel like that it could do that that politics could jeopardize it yes i really did i think what did i get myself into here maybe i did something i shouldn't have done <span class="delete">zach st louis</span> what's the mistake you're talking about having someone that was so far left that i couldn't live with <span class="replace">ooh</span> yeah this was a pretty low point in their marriage and they told me that they really wanted to find a way out of it we were both looking for some sort of i don't <span class="replace">wanna</span> say neutral but impartial news source i was hungry for something that i could count on to peel the layers away and really show what's in the heart of it they started reading different online news sources that branded themselves as being unbiased <span class="replace">plantfree</span> that kind of thing interesting and then they finally landed on something it was a newsletter dick seemed to like it <span class="replace">okay</span> so did emily we both agreed oh <span class="replace">yeah</span> let's read tangle tangle yes that's the newsletter all right so tell me about it it's this daily newsletter <span class="delete">it</span> comes to your email it's like a <span class="replace">substack type</span> thing it's run by a guy named <span class="insert">isaac saul</span> he started it he writes it they have about 135000 subscribers it comes to your inbox every weekday and each issue is all about one topic from the news what they try to do is summarize two or three of the best articles and arguments from <span class="replace">right leaning</span> sources about that topic and then they do the same thing with <span class="replace">left leaning</span> sources and the whole premise of the newsletter is that there are people out there like <span class="replace">deck</span> and emily that are reading completely separate sources and why not put all of those in one place so that's what the newsletter is <span class="insert">like</span> it's just like here's this topic here <span class="delete">are</span> a few stories from the left here <span class="delete">are</span> a few stories from the right yeah so you can <span class="delete">actually</span> read what those arguments are <span class="delete">i think</span> probably the first thing that astounded me was the transparency that when they make a mistake they <span class="replace">corrected</span> it as soon as they realize it and they put it right up front how is that different than corrections in a newspaper a little bit it's the way that they do it so corrections in a newspaper <span class="insert">you know</span> traditionally they are at the end of the article <span class="replace">it'll</span> be <span class="insert">like</span> a little footnote actually we got this wrong it's been changed above we <span class="replace">were got</span> the error <span class="replace">you know in like</span> little print italics at the bottom <span class="delete">mmhmm</span> tangle's <span class="replace">approached</span> to corrections it's a bit different can you show me yes this is from august <span class="replace">21st and</span> the very very top the very first thing that you see is correction period in big letters <span class="delete">mmhmm</span> in our coverage of the medicare drug pricing negotiations yesterday we said that four of the medicare part d <span class="delete">drugs</span> for <span class="replace">it's</span> the government had negotiated lower prices were overprescribed in the united states that was false we misread the abstract of a study and rushed our review process when we included it a sincere thank you to the <span class="replace">tanner</span> so readers who caught the error and then in <span class="replace">a talix</span> right below that this is our 114th correction <span class="replace">entangles 263 week</span> history and our first correction since august <span class="replace">13th</span> we track corrections and place them at the top of the newsletter in an effort to maximize transparency with readers so this is different than a newspaper i see yeah what else did dick and emily notice about tangle yeah so they noticed that it wasn't so sensational it was more measured or <span class="replace">even handed to</span> their language so for instance tangle noticed that readers on the right would sometimes unsubscribe from the newsletter after reading a phrase like undocumented immigrant but they also didn't think it was right to call someone illegal or an illegal alien so they did this big internal review and they settled on the term unauthorized migrant we really <span class="replace">like</span> that approach trying to filter out all the trigger words or the words that <span class="replace">weren't</span> very highly volatile emotionally which helps both of us then consider the issue with less emotion about it i'm not going to say with no emotion we would still argue but with less emotion about it and then we loved isaac's take what's isaac's take so isaac's take isaac refers to <span class="insert">isaac saul</span> he's the founder and writer of the newsletter <span class="delete">mmhmm</span> and at the end of every issue he spends a long time writing his opinion and these can be long and he says exactly how he feels about the issue after having researched it and just describes his own feeling about it <span class="delete">wait</span> do you have an example of this yeah here i'll send one to you we can look at it all right this was earlier this month hurricane helene and the disaster relief efforts yes the first part is just the topic <span class="replace">and</span> they summarize what the right is saying they summarize what the left is saying but then at the end you see my take and so i'm obviously not <span class="replace">gonna</span> read this whole thing it is yeah this is long wow 2200 words i looked it's like a whole essay but what's <span class="replace">this</span> take on hurricane helene yeah so before we get to his take i think you need to understand what he's responding to here <span class="replace">there've</span> been a lot of attacks on the biden administration from the right saying that they're doing nothing to help people who've been <span class="replace">infected</span> by this hurricane like actually nothing well that they failed to rise to the occasion basically so isaac he really puts a stake in the ground and says there's a big problem with this narrative it's all nonsense it's all a lie and then he writes i hate writing pieces like this it's not my job to defend the federal government from lies and it's hard to write a piece like this without reading it like i'm openly shilling for harris or biden i am not i'm not here to do their pr or protect their reputations however i do care about our information ecosystem i care about reliable accurate information being shared <span class="delete">widely</span> i also care about the north carolinians in danger right now not just because they're americans and it's a state i love but also because my mom my aunt my brother and his family my sisterinlaw and my niece they all live in north carolina so the horrors we're all witnessing on the news hit close to home here's the truth though biden and harris have actually pulled every lever federal executives can in a situation like this none of the critics that i posted above can say exactly what they want them to do that they aren't already doing and if you're planning on writing in to tell me that i am <span class="replace">chilling</span> for harris or being a leftwing hack by calling out lies online <span class="replace">you</span> better be prepared to tell me exactly what i've gotten wrong here and <span class="delete">then</span> he goes on for several more paragraphs oh wow interesting i can feel his resentment at having to defend the democratic administration yeah he's like i don't want to do this just to defend them but in this case they're doing everything they can and that's what the facts show and so i'm going to say that right and this part of the newsletter was something that dick and emily really came to appreciate he was very clear about what his biases were that made him extremely trustworthy more often than not when we get to the end and we read my take we look at each other and say yeah that's how i feel they started realizing that they actually agreed with each other on a lot of things and they were able to talk about it and eventually something pretty remarkable happened so remember how dick was totally convinced the election had been stolen he watched 2000 mules he read all of those conspiracies about it <span class="delete">mmhmm</span> so as dick and emily were starting to have this shared understanding of the news again tangle did the thing for dick that no other source seemed to be able to do that emily wasn't able to do and that was <span class="replace">proved</span> to him that the 2020 election had not been stolen the only thing that changed my mind completely was the fact that i started reading tangle and it's only because i trust isaac and his team so much it's incredibly fulfilling to be honest this is <span class="insert">isaac saul</span> he's the guy who writes tangle yes <span class="delete">just</span> it's actually so rewarding because the election fraud stuff in particular was one of the most difficult times of my life as a reporter the month after that election was dark stressful really really hard work and hearing that somebody had that reaction that their mind was actually changed even one person it's like yeah it makes me want to cry so am i getting this right it seems like isaac and this newsletter tangle they seem to have done something that i feel like so many journalists myself included have been banging our heads against the wall trying to figure out what to do which is how do you get people to believe the evidence that the 2020 election was not stolen from donald trump something like a third of americans believe <span class="replace">it</span> it was it's really threatening our ability to function how do you present those facts and get people to believe them i mean we did a whole episode of our show about barton <span class="replace">gelman</span> one of the greatest investigative reporters of our time i'd say who quit journalism because of this problem yeah and you're saying tangle did it in this case tangle did it yeah for dick tangle did it all right so how did tangle do this how did isaac the guy who runs this do this yeah so isaac did a ton of work around this whole election denialism issue it wasn't just one newsletter every time a new claim about how the election may have been stolen surfaced he would spend all this time running it down explaining in detail why it was false he did that in the days and weeks <span class="insert">and</span> immediately following the election he continued doing it as new <span class="replace">claim surface</span> in the years since but a lot of <span class="replace">new</span> sources have done this looked at these different claims about how the election was stolen and showed why they aren't true and looked at the court cases where no evidence surfaced and all this stuff right they did but isaac was doing a lot of research like for example in the weeks following the election right after he did this <span class="replace">400tweet long</span> thread that was going in detail into each claim he was really really deep on this but i don't think it was only the research that helped convince dick there's something else that isaac did and it was in his tone and how he approached this whole issue especially around the claims that seemed more persuasive he didn't just write them off he assessed them seriously he presented them seriously and that didn't make dick feel stupid here's isaac some of the stuff was really convincing and proving that they were wrong was not as simple as saying <span class="insert">like</span> oh this is just <span class="insert">like</span> conspiracy nonsense like the ballot stuffing thing <span class="insert">and</span> that was a plausible way to steal an election in 2022 he actually dedicated an entire newsletter a deep dive into 2000 <span class="replace">uels</span> that movie we were talking about so when that movie came out and everybody just <span class="replace">like lasted</span> dinesh d'souza i was kind of like i'm going to watch it and <span class="insert">like</span> take some of these allegations seriously and see what's up it turned out <span class="replace">they're</span> all bullshit but <span class="insert">like</span> you only know that if you actually do some of the work can <span class="delete">i</span> actually just read you what he wrote at the top of that newsletter yeah please so the title of the newsletter is an honest look at 2000 <span class="replace">uls</span> the new stolen election theory and this is how he opens it i consider myself to be both a skeptic and an openminded person <span class="replace">a</span> deeply cynical about our government believe intelligence agencies are covering up the truth about ufos and don't feel any particular loyalty to any major political parties i generally distrust authority government agencies and politicians but i do believe it's wise to consult expert opinions and advice i love a good conspiracy a good coverup and a great story a stolen presidential election would be an alltimer in every regard a story so gigantic a conspiracy of corruption and power so unthinkable that the idea alone is tantalizing enough i almost want to believe it and then he goes on to dissect every point made in the film and show why it's inaccurate but that's how he starts interesting <span class="replace">okay</span> so that's the presentation difference you're talking about yeah and i'll just say that that framing it's really different from how other outlets covered this film like for example there's a new york times headline about the movie it was quote a big lie in a new package there was a washington post headline that was quote 2000 mules offers the least convincing election <span class="replace">for a</span> theory yet and look i mean that's all true it is a lie but isaac realized he's probably not going to convince someone who already believes the lie by leading with that so instead he levels with people explains where he's coming from and all the research he did and then explains what he found about the claims and so this was what dick was reading after reading his article what i realized was and he even admitted there were some things that were happening that shouldn't have been happening in some of the polls but it wouldn't have changed the dynamics of who won and who lost at all that was actually the first time i really realized it for sure and that really opened my eyes to how corrupt that was that really sold me on the fact that the election wasn't stolen what i was thinking in my head was like i want to bring all these people in my life under one roof and i want them to be able to read a <span class="replace">new</span> source that <span class="replace">like the you know</span> trump maga bro will trust and <span class="replace">like the left wing</span> bernie bro will trust what was the <span class="insert">like</span> origin story for tangle for isaac <span class="insert">like</span> he was a reporter before this yeah he was a reporter he worked for huffington post a couple of other places and he told me that he's always been the type of person that's brought together people from different backgrounds in his personal life maybe they don't agree and he's often mediating between those people but really the inspiration for tangle came out of his own news consumption the idea for tangle basically came from the trump era of <span class="insert">like</span> trump proposes a border wall and i'm like he's <span class="insert">like</span> proposing a <span class="replace">2000 mile</span> border wall this sounds totally insane i can't imagine the best argument for this but i really want to understand is this something that would actually work and in order to grasp what was actually happening my day would be like i'm <span class="replace">gonna</span> go read the new york times editorial board i'm <span class="replace">gonna</span> read their immigration reporting about it then i'm <span class="replace">gonna</span> go to fox news and scroll through their opinion page and search for trump's border wall and then maybe i'll listen to <span class="insert">like</span> a ben shapiro podcast and then i'll go listen to <span class="replace">potsay of</span> america and then <span class="delete">i'll</span> watch the daily show do a bit about it or watch john oliver and then i'll spend <span class="insert">like</span> an hour on some tucker carlson special about it and then i'll do <span class="insert">like</span> 10 hours of all this consuming <span class="delete">of</span> the news and i'll sit down and i'll be like <span class="replace">okay</span> i think i now have a really good understanding of everybody's perspective positive and negative about this policy proposal why can't i just find that one place that should exist somewhere do you know who's reading the newsletter i kind of do based on a reader survey of tangle subscribers so a little bit over half of the subscribers are men around <span class="replace">50's having percent it's q's</span> very white just below 90 of readers it's usbased but isaac says it does reach something like 55 other countries and about a third of the readers say that they're on the left a third on the right and the last third are either <span class="insert">a</span> center or independent <span class="replace">well</span> so it's pretty evenly politically split yeah pretty even split politically and i did talk to some other readers of the newsletter who said that it had an impact on them similar to dick and emily like who i met this one guy at <span class="insert">like</span> a political event in new york and he told me it's basically the only news that he reads i talked to a new reader of tangle a journalist actually and he said that there were some arguments from the right that he'd just written off but reading tangle actually helped him see that they had a point and i even spoke to another guy who <span class="replace">liked</span> dick <span class="replace">how does mine change</span> about the 2020 election <span class="replace">i've seen</span> that donald trump was telling me the truth that they had firm evidence that it was definitely manipulation of the ballots this is a guy named rick wait rick and dick rick and dick <span class="replace">okay</span> both richard if you want to be technical about it got it go on it's a really similar story to dick and emily's rick was a big trump supporter voted for him twice rick's son is on the left politically they were arguing about the news a lot and the <span class="replace">sun</span> started forwarding rick the newsletter including issues that were about the stolen election claims <span class="delete">rick</span> they <span class="replace">were</span> just laughing it off i have a trust in their news gathering <span class="insert">gathering</span> and presentation abilities <span class="replace">ken</span> and shoulders above any other news gathering source i have a trust level there that's unequaled and again like dick and emily rick and his son have mended their relationship they can talk to each other about the news again and now he doesn't think the election was stolen and that feeling of being lied to it's actually convinced him not to vote for trump this year really <span class="delete">rick</span> yeah the only reason i <span class="replace">went and</span> vote for him <span class="delete">is</span> because he made me look foolish in front <span class="replace">on</span> my <span class="replace">side you know</span> zach you mentioned the importance of striking the right tone when we're presenting evidence especially evidence that's <span class="insert">like</span> contrary to what someone believes and that does seem important but also <span class="insert">you know</span> just hearing the story of rick and his son alongside the story of dick and emily his wife <span class="insert">like</span> i do just <span class="replace">wondered</span> does a person have to be motivated to get along with someone they love to repair a relationship essentially in order to change their mind yeah it's a good question wanting to see something from someone else's perspective the perspective of someone you love it seems like that doesn't hurt <span class="insert">you know</span> it's interesting thinking about it it's not exactly that tangle moved both of them towards the center and they met in the middle but it moved dick more towards emily basically yeah i mean obviously it would make for a better story if they each moved toward the center i think that's sort of <span class="replace">meant</span> in the middle what we want from a story like this exactly <span class="replace">meant</span> in the middle but it's really more like dick believed something that wasn't true and then he was the one that moved toward facts how does emily say it changed her <span class="insert">like</span> does she say it changed her so she told me that she didn't have as dramatic a change as dick it wasn't like she believed something that wasn't true and had her mind changed but she says she does read the news differently now for instance she told me that hearing some of kamala harris's policy proposals and how before she would have taken some of them at face value <span class="replace">it was</span> good ideas now she says she's thinking more critically about them <span class="delete">hmm</span> how are they doing these days yeah the last time i spoke to them they really did seem to be in a better place i think on the surface it seemed like their problem was that <span class="replace">they've</span> been talking across this political divide but their real problem was that they weren't agreeing on facts they weren't agreeing on what was true that's what made it so bitter <span class="replace">is it hugely</span> dick and i can now agree on more or disagree based on the same information at least i don't feel like i'm walking on <span class="replace">age shells</span> if i want to mention something to her i mean she's her own person i'm not going to tell her who to vote for and she wouldn't listen to me anyway now we're on the same handbook more or less although he might be reading a different page than me at the time but it's generally the same handbook but i mean agreeing on the same set of facts being in the same book that's only going to get you so far who's dick voting for <span class="insert">you know</span> as far as i'm concerned i don't like trump as a person the way he handles himself the things he says it bothers me a lot but the one thing that i did like about him was his policies and so i'm definitely leaning towards trump still <span class="replace">okay</span> that's <span class="replace">that's that's dix</span> that's my <span class="replace">thing</span> that's the first time that he's verbalized to me that he's thinking about voting for trump my heart just stopped emily and <span class="insert">dick newton</span> in orange county california so that's <span class="replace">brian read and zack st louis</span> of the podcast question everything which is produced by kcrw and placement theory <span class="replace">which were resettled</span> by jonathan goldstein and <span class="replace">robin semyon</span> coming up other couples muddling <span class="replace">the</span> way through this election using slightly more extreme tactics that's in a minute <span class="replace">i'm just going to go up a great deal</span> when our program continues <span class="delete">act two till death do us partisan</span> it's <span class="delete">this</span> american life <span class="replace">from ira goss</span> today's program a small thing that gives me a tiny shred of hope <span class="replace">okay</span> so it was act one and the tangle newsletter that inspired that name for today's episode now in the second half of the show the thread from that story that we're going to pick up and keep pulling is what is happening with couples during this election which is interesting because as <span class="replace">you've</span> probably heard there's a real gender gap between men and women this time out <span class="replace">one preferred</span> trump by <span class="replace">eight</span> percentage points women prefer harris by <span class="replace">nine</span> with that we turn to act two of our show act two <span class="replace">to</span> death <span class="replace">dewest</span> partisan <span class="replace">okay</span> so if you remember emily and dick who we heard in act one they talk openly between them about their political differences one of our producers <span class="insert">the bv decornfeld</span> spoke with a woman who <span class="replace">was</span> taking a different tactic with her husband it's been hard to find a time to talk with <span class="replace">june</span> on a <span class="replace">three week</span> road trip with her husband and they have almost no time apart so we look for little cracks in <span class="replace">our</span> schedule to sneak in a call do you have a sense of how much time we have right now <span class="replace">i'm</span> about a half an hour he's in the shower <span class="replace">okay oh</span> half an hour long shower <span class="replace">look jury</span> well he has a whole routine <span class="replace">you know peace</span> and everything yeah yeah he's like a teenage girl <span class="replace">and</span> that way <span class="replace">okay</span> do you mind if i record this call i don't mind but i'm a little bit concerned about <span class="insert">you know</span> i don't want to get in trouble the trouble <span class="replace">june's</span> trying to avoid is an argument with her husband they're both conservatives but after voting republican for her entire life this election <span class="insert">june</span> will be secretly voting for kamala harris her husband doesn't know about her plans <span class="delete">and</span> so <span class="insert">i really just</span> that's sort of why i'm a secret voter is because i'll vote however i want to vote but having the conversations about it is where things get <span class="replace">so comfortable</span> while we talk <span class="insert">june</span> is pacing around the backyard of their rental house where her husband can't hear her it's not like she's scared of him she just doesn't want to fight with him which is why we're using <span class="replace">her</span> pseudonym <span class="replace">june's</span> not <span class="replace">a</span> real name the harris campaign is counting on the idea that there are lots of <span class="replace">june's</span> out there they're marketing to these women specifically sending republicans like liz cheney all over the country to talk to them and there's a whole grassroots effort of people sticking postit notes in public restrooms reminding these women their vote is private i wondered what it was like for people in this situation is it really possible to keep a secret like this from the person you share a house and a life with how do you do that what are the consequences on our call <span class="insert">june</span> made a point to say it wasn't always this way she's been with <span class="replace">our</span> husband who i'll call rick for 20 years now they first met in an online group for single parents <span class="insert">june</span> had three little kids from a previous pretty rough marriage rick had two kids and their courtship started over the phone yes i mean like being in middle school like you'd spend all day with your best friend in <span class="insert">the</span> middle school and then immediately come home and get on the phone with her we would just talk for hours and hours and hours it just felt like the easiest most natural connection by the time <span class="insert">june</span> and rick actually met in real life a few months later they were basically already a couple a year later they got married and rick raised <span class="replace">june's</span> kids as his own calls <span class="replace">him</span> his kids <span class="insert">june</span> says rick was totally <span class="replace">a political one</span> they met had never voted wasn't even registered which did not sit right with <span class="insert">june</span> she's always been very politically engaged makes a real effort to vote in every election not just the big ones since <span class="insert">june</span> was a lifelong republican rick also registered as a republican and in 2016 they both voted for donald trump together <span class="replace">june</span> immediately regretted it she never liked trump but it felt wrong to her not to vote and she assumed he wouldn't win anyway after the election <span class="insert">june</span> started to lean away from her political party but rick reached towards it he started watching fox news every day and it's just <span class="replace">during</span> something up inside of him that makes him afraid or just <span class="insert">like</span> angsty or whatever and <span class="insert">like</span> it just comes bubbling out <span class="insert">like</span> he's not a big talker to anybody else i'm the main person that he talks to so i think if he talked to a lot of people maybe i wouldn't be getting so much of it down the barrel but because i'm his <span class="insert">you know i'm his</span> main person i think i get it all because i think it makes him very anxious like if you heard and believed every day that you're going to lose your freedom you're <span class="replace">no longer</span> job you're going to lose your way of life all these terrible things are going to happen i think it's natural that you would be anxious <span class="replace">do you see a friend</span> no not even one i mean he has <span class="delete">so</span> one of the pastors at my church really likes him but no <span class="replace">i</span> really like people very much <span class="insert">i see i see i see i see i see i see i see</span> rick used to ask <span class="insert">june</span> about her opinion on politics she would read articles and he would ask her to summarize them for him that was <span class="replace">a</span> dynamic she researched and came to an opinion and he trusted her opinions but these days the longer that donald trump has been on the picture the sort of more like him my husband becomes <span class="insert">you know</span> just i'm not allowed to have my own opinions <span class="replace">opinions i</span> better not vote this way or that way or i'm going to go with you and vote and <span class="insert">you're</span> just really getting <span class="insert">a</span> very hostile about it and i guess donald trump just made it easier or more acceptable or more popular to act like that and <span class="replace">that's</span> the only area where he's like that but if we have a big confrontation about it then it becomes everything <span class="delete">you know</span> it's just <span class="replace">like</span> i hear a little dog in the background yes yes we have <span class="replace">to obviously both do yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah june</span> is having this disagreement with <span class="replace">our</span> husband during a moment when election coverage is nonstop ads are everywhere both campaigns are relentlessly calling and texting and emailing all while she's stuck in a car with her husband and this is all he wants to talk about she said they planned this trip a year ago when things were calm and now she can't believe she did this to herself it's been very tense but <span class="replace">june's</span> got a couple strategies for dealing when politics comes up sometimes she tries something called gray rocking which is basically just being as boring as possible in conversation so rick has nothing to seize on or react to other times she tries for a classic maneuver the dodge i dodge a lot no i'm pretty good at dodging because i'm very busy honey i'm very busy making dinner i'm very busy <span class="insert">you know</span> with <span class="delete">the</span> cleaning or i have to do some work or whatever so i'd say maybe <span class="insert">it'd be</span> once every 10 days to two weeks do i let my guard down and when her guard drops a fight ensues they have a big fight every 10 days to two weeks because <span class="replace">it</span> keeps bringing politics up he wants to talk to her about all this stuff and it unsettles him when they're not on the same page he wants her to engage and so her refusal itself becomes a kind of fuel it ends up being very pushy you know like why aren't you talking to me why <span class="replace">are you doing so many like i'll</span> say things and i just <span class="replace">peek</span> the bait you know he'll say <span class="insert">like</span> you're a liberal <span class="delete">and</span> what do you say i say i've been a conservative <span class="replace">one and then</span> you've been a conservative what are you talking about <span class="replace">like</span> i am a conservative donald trump stole my party do you regret getting him politically engaged given how things have turned out totally really totally yes i talked to a bunch of people like <span class="insert">june</span> women who <span class="replace">planned a</span> vote for kamala but are going to all sorts of lengths to avoid telling their family and friends about it they're all lifelong conservatives but then for a lot of them january <span class="replace">6th</span> crossed a red line they didn't even know they had until it happened and now they can't bring themselves to vote for trump again i talked to one woman in louisiana who told me her parents knew she wasn't going to vote for trump they assume she's going to write in another republican which she's happy to let them think she said it's inconceivable to her parents that she could possibly vote for a democrat another woman in missouri told me that once <span class="replace">kamla</span> entered the race she tried to test the waters with her family said she was thinking that maybe she would vote for <span class="replace">kamla</span> her family's reaction was so strong they said she was going to hell that she was a communist that she <span class="replace">ended a</span> backtrack <span class="insert">and</span> they haven't talked about it again since i mentioned all this to <span class="insert">june</span> i've talked to a bunch of people who are in different versions of your situation and everyone tries to avoid talking about politics with their family because they obviously want to maintain close relationships with their family and they avoid talking about it in service of the relationship but actually they just can't be as close with their family as they want to be if they can't really share this part of their life with them right i think we sort of watch movies and tv shows where <span class="insert">like</span> one <span class="insert">sort of</span> explosive thing happens that ends up destroying a relationship or whatever it is but i think in actuality those kinds of deteriorations happen little by little over time and it's <span class="replace">the</span> small things that chip away at any family relationship or any kind of relationship and so i think i probably just make a <span class="replace">short term</span> easy decision to avoid it and <span class="replace">that</span> probably does have <span class="replace">longer term</span> consequences i want to be clear <span class="insert">june</span> and rick still have nice parts of their marriage they still go on their daily walks they have those two little dogs that they both obsess over rick does this whole routine with the dogs during their nightly snack time which delights <span class="insert">june</span> but with the walltowall election noise politics is increasingly crowding out those other more peaceful parts of their lives <span class="delete">i have</span> an older sister who's married to a likeminded man and their relationship is just so different there's just so much more back and forth between the two of them and there's so much less <span class="replace">to say so</span> about <span class="insert">like</span> she can be who she wants to be and he's <span class="delete">just</span> more secure in that <span class="insert">you know</span> she can voice her opinion <span class="insert">and</span> and it just doesn't ever seem like she's looking over her shoulder but i definitely feel like i need to look over my shoulder obviously <span class="replace">and</span> sitting in <span class="replace">the bed</span> i just feel like i have to look over my back shoulder not because something necessarily bad will happen to me but <span class="insert">just like</span> it's just too exhausting to keep explaining myself i guess i just don't really want to keep <span class="replace">you wanting</span> that who does your husband think you're voting for i think he's afraid <span class="delete">that</span> i'm going to vote for kamala i think he has a clue that i'm a <span class="replace">nevertrunker</span> but i wouldn't say he knows for 100 sure tell me if this is way <span class="replace">offbase</span> sure because i don't mean to overstep but it sounds kind of lonely <span class="delete">being in a oh my gosh it's terrible marriage</span> oh my gosh it's terrible don't make me cry <span class="delete">yes he's not who i thought he was or he's becoming somebody that yes it's like</span> i'm not <span class="replace">sure</span> who i am with him <span class="delete">and</span> it's sad <span class="delete">yeah</span> do you have <span class="delete">a i don't know</span> a plan for if it keeps going down this road <span class="delete">or</span> do you have any red lines <span class="delete">or you're just</span> hoping <span class="insert">you know</span> once the election is over then you can go back to talking about <span class="replace">it</span> yeah it sort of <span class="insert">like</span> steams up and then cools off steams up and then cools off yeah i probably am not going to do anything i mean i'm on the phone i'll be done in just five minutes <span class="replace">okay</span> yeah it's not <span class="insert">like</span> a fun life to talk about donald trump i just want to forget about <span class="replace">them</span> was that your husband who came out <span class="insert">yeah okay it</span> just <span class="delete">now yeah ok just it</span> sounds like you should go i <span class="delete">should</span> probably <span class="replace">wrapped</span> it up yeah <span class="replace">okay</span> well i'll let you go i really appreciate you talking sure sure thank you it was good to talk with you thank you <span class="replace">okay</span> all right <span class="delete">bye</span> bye a few days after our call i got a text from <span class="insert">june</span> she was home from her trip and had gone to vote early with her daughter she sent me a selfie of the two of them beaming with their matching voting stickers they both voted for <span class="replace">kamla june</span> said she felt relieved to have cast her vote because now no one could take it away from her and more than that she actually feels excited about the prospect of a harris presidency she thinks she'll do a good job after they voted <span class="insert">june</span> and her daughter celebrated <span class="replace">hug</span> goodbye and then <span class="replace">june peelder stick</span> her <span class="delete">sticker</span> off and went home <span class="insert">a viva de cornfeld</span> is one of the producers of our show <span class="replace">okay</span> so the biggest gap between men and women in this election is with younger voters <span class="delete">people</span> under 30 <span class="delete">an</span> nbc <span class="replace">newspoll</span> found that 59 of young women in that group support harris compared to 42 of men <span class="replace">but it's</span> got us wondering how is a person that age supposed to find love those numbers if you are straight and under 30 and looking for somebody <span class="replace">at</span> the same party they are not great and that question brings us to act three of our show act three let me be frank so when <span class="insert">aviva de cornfeu</span> was reaching out to couples looking for people to interview for the story that you just heard one of the people she came across was a guy named <span class="insert">frank filacomo</span> he's trying to navigate his way through the rocky <span class="replace">shows</span> this gender divide so she talked to him too about what that's like last year frank had a date that went exactly the way you hope a first date goes the conversation felt easy they made each other laugh and at the end of the date they said good night no kiss <span class="replace">and</span> kiss on first dates and went home and then <span class="insert">we were texted</span> she was texting me right after the date had such a great time when do we get to do this again and we're exchanging ideas for what our next <span class="replace">date's</span> going to be and then the morning of the second date she messages me and she said i did some thinking and i would not like to go out with you again and what do you <span class="replace">think's</span> happening when she says that well i didn't think i knew what happened oh what happened what happened is that i have a very unique italian last name if you google me i come right up i think i wrote so you must have looked me up and she said yes and she sent me a screenshot and i went ah got it the thing frank's date had discovered about him he's a republican voted for trump twice the screenshot was of an article he'd written for a conservative magazine trying to date <span class="delete">in</span> deep blue new york city as a registered republican perhaps unsurprisingly not so easy he knows better than to lead with his politics he intentionally leaves it off <span class="replace">as</span> dating profile but even so sometimes frank can't even get past the texting phase <span class="replace">nonpothe</span> actual date a lot of women have said <span class="replace">okay you know</span> you seem great and i'd like to meet you and go on a date but first <span class="insert">you know</span> who did you vote for or what are your politics oh really and then that's when i what do you say <span class="insert">you know</span> i say that i'm an independent thinker and <span class="insert">you know</span> that's really coded as <span class="replace">my way that's</span> exactly and you might as well just say i voted for donald trump yeah and i have and then what <span class="replace">are</span> they <span class="replace">saying</span> they say well i can't do it can't do it by frank's estimate 40 to 50 women have canceled their dates with him upon discovering his politics having been born and raised in brooklyn frank has this sort of odd problem on his hands because he basically fits in unless he's talking everyone i've ever met has told me that they think i'm some bernie progressive i strike people as being <span class="replace">left to wing</span> yeah <span class="replace">when</span> you live in brooklyn and you have little glasses so i have little glasses and holes in my ears he used to have gauges he also has a bunch of tattoos he's a real mix of things he's got some punk in him but he's also nerdy casually says words like <span class="replace">for clumped</span> and pugilistic <span class="replace">though</span> you can't see any of his edge today came straight from his job at a rightwing nonprofit so he's in his full conservative drag suit tie token fun socks frank's been a conservative since he was little he grew up in a rightleaning household and proudly wore a <span class="replace">mccain paylon</span> button on his backpack at school <span class="replace">and</span> he was 11 the main thing that makes frank a conservative these days he says is that national sovereignty is extremely important to him meaning he thinks we should close the border build a wall if we need to anything to discourage undocumented immigrants from coming here otherwise basically he's one of those fiscally conservative socially liberal guys but his dates mostly care about that conservative part he remembers this one first date <span class="replace">they're</span> really kind of stung because he was particularly excited about her <span class="replace">they're</span> at a bar bantering back and forth and then she said so what do you do for work and there's kind of no way around that you know i could <span class="insert">say i could</span> be super ambiguous and say oh i work for a nonprofit <span class="delete">yeah</span> but then that lends itself to <span class="replace">okay</span> well which nonprofit yeah that can mean anything right frank told her he worked for a branch of the famously conservative outlet the national review where he occasionally writes his date <span class="replace">that</span> he meant the nation which is kind of the opposite and <span class="delete">then</span> i clarified <span class="replace">now</span> a little different <span class="replace">how'd</span> you describe the difference i said we're more on the right which is my euphemistic way of saying we're conservative because we are and i said that and immediately her whole demeanor changed like what she leans back in her chair <span class="delete">or something</span> yeah <span class="replace">yep yep</span> body language changed and she said well so you're a conservative they were only 20 minutes into the date and decided to call it a night i actually planned on walking her out or walking her to the train station and so i said <span class="replace">okay</span> let me get the bill and i go up to the bar to get the bill and then i came back and she was gone frank thought maybe she'd gone to the bathroom but his date had <span class="replace">scootered</span> to the bar and arrived with a helmet frank noticed the helmet was also gone i'm thinking i don't think she took her helmet to the bathroom but i said let me give it a few minutes you know and i gave it a few minutes and i said <span class="insert">she's not</span> she left <span class="insert">♪ music playing in background</span> it does hurt and when i say this to people i don't mean to make it into a pity thing <span class="insert">you know</span> it's not like this is being conservative <span class="replace">as</span> some immutable characteristic right i don't want people to feel bad for me but it does hurt because to me it's like who am i so <span class="insert">after 27 years</span> i'm 27 after 27 years of existence if my identity boils down to being a conservative and a registered republican then that's a sad 27 years that i've lived that's really sad frank's a registered republican but to him that's the least interesting thing about him here are some things that frank would like people to know about him he plays jazz guitar he has a very old cat 17 years old who is still in remarkably good health he's also obsessed with aquariums he has four of them in his studio apartment the stuff that frank thinks should matter is the way you comport yourself in the world are you polite to wait staff do you hold the door for people do you check in on your friends when they're sick most of a relationship he says is not about politics and so he wants the <span class="replace">woman</span> he dates to see those other parts of him not be blinded by his party affiliation so he's tried various tactics over the years to get around it downplaying addressing it head on and making a case for himself once since women kept googling him and finding his writing he even gave a fake <span class="replace">glass</span> name but that made me feel terrible about myself so it wasn't worth <span class="replace">knowing</span> that yeah that's no way to go through life i asked frank why not just date conservative women he insisted the conservative dating pool in new york city is simply too small there's a filter on the dating app hinge that you can pay for that does let you filter for political preference he did try that once and i realized that it was <span class="insert">it was</span> meaningless you know <span class="delete">hmm</span> i'm attracted to people for other reasons in fact i would put politics probably at the end what yeah that's crazy why is that crazy because the thing that should be at the end is like my favorite color is green that's more important no it's not it absolutely is more important why well i'm tempted to push it back on you and say why is politics important it's not important i don't think so at all actually yeah but do you think that politics is less important to you because some of the policies that you might be voting for directly impact you in a less personal way than they impact the women that you want to date oh maybe i think that's part of it and i have a lot of empathy for people who are impacted more directly but i think that <span class="insert">you know</span> i look at my <span class="replace">day to day</span> life and <span class="insert">you know</span> i'll walk through a door and someone or i'll hold the door for someone and they'll walk through and they won't say thank you and i go what was that what was that about <span class="insert">you know</span> it's stuff like that little interpersonal interactions that mean something to me you know or but to you but not to the people that you're dating i'm sure the women you're dating would be much it's much more important to them to be able to get an abortion than have a door held for them oh sure but i'm one out of 340 million people i'm not effectuating policy or something i can see why his dates don't see it that way i have some news to end this story with which is that after dozens of dates frank is actually <span class="replace">seen</span> someone it's new but it seems to be going well she's a lefty and she knows all about his views politics actually came up on their first date it's been a few months now and they've had a lot of conversations about politics frank told me his girlfriend's voting for kamala harris and the idea that frank might vote for trump that really really bothers her recently with the election coming up they had one particularly hard conversation about it she said <span class="insert">you know</span> we care for each other and we obviously enjoy being around each other and we have for the past four or five months however long it's been and <span class="insert">you know</span> i don't think she said that she doesn't think it's a <span class="replace">deal breaker</span> for her but it's something that concerns her you know and i don't take that lightly so it's made me do a lot of thinking <span class="delete">and</span> what'd you say i said that i want you to know that i hear you it was emotional i think we were both a little <span class="replace">veerkelemped</span> his girlfriend kept saying trump's a rapist you've got to vote for the whole person not just the policies you like these conversations with his girlfriend and other people have actually moved him and so frank is thinking of voting third party <span class="insert">of</span> this election which may have more meaning in his relationship than it does for our country thanks to the fucking electoral college like most of us frank doesn't live in a swing state <span class="insert">i'm even a cornfeld</span> we first heard about frank in a story in the guardian <span class="replace">you can't just sit on the side while you're just wasting our time you can't just wait and see gotta make a difference for you on my own oh yeah if you don't speak you'll never be heard so get on your feet and jump
