            <p>parents here is all the evidence <span class="insert">that</span> you need <span class="replace">the</span> tv is bad for kids especially public tv when sean was 14 he loved watching those british tv shows they're always running on pbs masterpiece theater <span class="replace">dr</span> who and then there was this show that i would stay up really late and watch and tape and watch over and over again the tapes called dempsey and <span class="replace">makepiece</span> which was about an american detective who went to london because he had been like <span class="replace">set up</span> at home and he was teamed up with a woman who was this aristocrat named lady harriet <span class="replace">makepiece</span> and i was really on her side <span class="delete">i thought</span> you know she's got it going on you looked down on the <span class="replace">america</span> oh yeah <span class="replace">but you don't like to bet</span> lady harriet <span class="replace">makepiece</span> and all the other brits on tv was their <span class="replace">or a goofness</span> how they seemed above it all how they looked down on americans which <span class="replace">shondit</span> also convinced there must be something wrong with the nation that produced jocks and bullies who harassed him in school and sometimes joking around with his friends <span class="replace">you</span> would talk with <span class="replace">the</span> british accent and then it was just something that spiraled out of control i know that eventually i was just using an english accent literally from waking to sleeping morning noon and night <span class="replace">shantzburg</span> with <span class="replace">the</span> british accent from the time he was 14 until he was 16 and at some point his mom thought you know maybe i need to do something about this and took him to see a psychiatrist <span class="insert">he was just really he must</span> i don't <span class="insert">know you</span> know the different schools of psychology but he was really very <span class="replace">confrontive and he was</span> like well <span class="insert">you know</span> you've got to stop doing this <span class="delete">he said</span> because you're not british and my mom just sort of sat over next to me and she sort of went yeah to agree with him and to sort of help him in showing me this <span class="replace">shah misfurious</span> he had an <span class="replace">embole's</span> lecture <span class="insert">of</span> the guy on how in fact he was british and the only problem with that was that a he knew very well that he was not and b his mom was sitting right there she was sure to contradict <span class="replace">them</span> he didn't know what to do his situation seemed impossible because that's what i was thinking like there has to be a way that i can be british still there must be a way that this is true somehow yeah exactly <span class="replace">but at the honor</span> radio program stories of people who tell a lie and they get to the point where they believe the lie more than anybody else does it feels like it must be true <span class="insert">so</span> happens all the time and <span class="replace">gotta</span> say we are not even <span class="replace">gonna</span> get into what happens with political figures in this show kidding themselves about the facts of things today we have stories of civilians people like you and me basically pulling hoaxes on ourselves from <span class="replace">wbz</span> chicago it's this american life i'm ira glass <span class="replace">like</span> one of our <span class="replace">programs</span> today the sun never sets on the moosewood restaurant <span

the sun never <span class="replace">sets on</span> the moosewood restaurant so this is the story of two young people who for a period in their lives <span class="replace">and they're searched</span> to figure out who they were pretended to be people who they were not we're going to hear from sean cole and from joel lovell we're going to start with sean today's show is a rerun this was <span class="replace">quoted</span> years ago these days sean is a producer here at our show sean grew up in a small town in massachusetts <span class="replace">the</span> town that was approximately 3350 miles from london it was second nature it was first nature <span class="insert">it was you know</span> to this day i have trouble saying oh i faked an accent for two years i mean i had an accent for two years <span class="insert">so</span> i like sean could i just <span class="replace">ask you</span> to take a deep breath and describe for me what you had for lunch today or perhaps for breakfast this morning in as close to the accent that you <span class="replace">cannot</span> as close as i can <span class="delete">muster</span> yeah <span class="replace">okay</span> i'm <span class="replace">gonna</span> take a sip of water here well <span class="delete">ira</span> i had a salad i had it at the boston house of pancakes or <span class="insert">a</span> pizza rather what was the beverage it was a snapple just lemon <span class="replace">flavoured</span> i don't really like the peach <span class="replace">joe</span> lovell's story began when he left the working class town where he grew up in upstate new york his parents owned a liquor store in a small town he was the first member of his family to go to college and it was an especially big deal because he got into an ivy league school <span class="replace">quite now</span> it was one of those first days of college you know when <span class="replace">he spent</span> a lot of time <span class="delete">everybody</span> kind of moves <span class="replace">and</span> hordes and you spend a lot of time in each other's dorm rooms and there were about oh i don't know 10 or 11 of us in this one guy's room and we were just like sitting around eating pizza and talking and people were talking about <span class="insert">what they're you know</span> where they were from and what their parents did and stuff like that and there was one guy whose dad was a doctor for the knicks there was another guy whose father was an elected representative from new york state and then this other guy whose father was on the world court literally was a member of the world court <span class="replace">i'm mine</span> and so it suddenly seemed like this incredibly sort of impressive group to me and they seemed like just sort of worldly in ways that <span class="insert">you know there</span> was just beyond my wildest imagination and <span class="insert">you know</span> worldly beyond what i am now frankly and i remember <span class="delete">sort of</span> sitting there at the time thinking oh my god i'm so out of my league here and then completely unplanned i suddenly said as a slice of pizza was passed <span class="replace">i mean this sort of</span> pizza <span class="replace">would</span> sausage on top of it i said <span class="delete">you know</span> i can't take that because my parents are vegetarians and everybody in the room <span class="delete">sort of</span> turned and looked at me because it wasn't even as if i said well i'm a vegetarian but i said <span class="delete">you know</span> my parents are vegetarians and there's a sort of puzzled look on everybody in the room and i said well <span class="insert">you know</span> and i am too i've never eaten meat and i'm not entirely well i mean i have some ideas now about why i said that but at the time i had no idea what i was saying it was like suddenly i'd become possessed and i had to think of something to say about myself that seemed interesting and <span class="insert">in</span> vegetarianism was the thing that i chose now <span class="replace">did</span> you tell people that you were actually from england <span class="delete">no</span> no never that i was from britain but in a way that i was british you know there was a real distinction there for me like <span class="insert">i you know</span> i'd taken it on like i was culturally british now well i think what it was is i <span class="insert">mean i</span> think i did some sort of calculus that took like a nanosecond in my head and i thought <span class="delete">you know</span> i can't actually lie about what my parents do but i think the connections that i was making were this that somehow because i was from this town <span class="replace">and</span> the sticks if my folks were vegetarians then the whole history that that suggested was that they were sort of these kind of leftist academic radicals who had sort of dropped out of society and gone back to the land and i was living in this <span class="replace">pumpkin</span> town in upstate <span class="insert">in</span> new york and my folks were living some sort of life that was driven by their political philosophy rather than i was just a guy who grew up in <span class="insert">an</span> upstate <span class="insert">in</span> new york you know i did the old kid thing of <span class="delete">like</span> wishing that my real british parents would come and tell me i was adopted and take me back to london so i'm sitting there in the room and all these guys are looking at me and they're like dude what do you eat and suddenly i realized <span class="insert">i realized</span> in that moment <span class="delete">how</span> little i knew about vegetarianism and i kind of tried to be <span class="insert">a real</span> sort of vague about it you know we <span class="delete">eat</span> salads and lentils i remember sort of saying lentils a lot <span class="insert">you know</span> and there was a gap certainly in my education because <span class="insert">like</span> i would be using <span class="insert">you know</span> words that americans just don't use you know <span class="insert">i would</span> instead of saying drugstore i would say chemist or <span class="insert">you know</span> i would try my best to remember to say <span class="insert">you know</span> bonnet instead of hood or boot instead of trunk but i often couldn't on the meal plan i ended up eating a lot of big piles of iceberg lettuce and chickpeas and during that time would you find yourself sneaking to go to get meat somewhere yeah definitely at first i would go really far from campus in order to have like a blt <span class="insert">there was this</span> there's this diner downtown in ithaca <span class="insert">and</span> it felt incredibly illicit i'd be sitting there and i'd have some reading material or something with me and i'd be the lonely guy in my booth and i would order the blt and i would sort of watch it <span class="insert">kind of</span> coming from across the room with its toothpick in the top of it and a side of french fries with <span class="replace">this</span> meat gravy on top and <span class="insert">it would just you know</span> when it landed on the table it would just seem like this incredibly <span class="insert">you know</span> sort of wonderful moment you know when you're doing something <span class="insert">just</span> just totally unlike what anybody would expect of you i was <span class="delete">a</span> nobody <span class="insert">you know</span> i mean i was living in <span class="replace">a really like</span> extremely small kind of rural town in the middle of nowhere it was i guess in a way <span class="insert">like</span> this was my way of traveling <span class="insert">you know</span> in a way <span class="delete">and</span> of being somebody and sort <span class="insert">of</span> of achieving an identity which i guess i didn't feel like i had i didn't feel like <span class="delete">i</span> i'm just sort of <span class="delete">really</span> realizing this now but i guess i didn't feel as though i had anything that made me up i mean what i realized fairly quickly is that if this is going to be believable i actually have to well i have to believe in it but i also began to not only believe but really sort of take on as my persona all of the stuff that i imagined was associated with vegetarianism <span class="insert">so</span> like what well <span class="insert">you know certain</span> certain political convictions and ways of dress i wore ripped jeans and i wore combat boots but i also wore like a kind of stage jacket that you would see in a community theater production of hamlet yeah <span class="delete">you know</span> i bought sandals i very specifically remember going down to this thrift store in downtown ithaca and buying a pair of fatigue shorts which just seemed like you know i might as well have been <span class="replace">shea guaveira</span> at that point <span class="insert">this morning</span> i mean as far as i was concerned <span class="insert">i was</span> yeah i was a dangerous leftist did you at any point during this find yourself in the following argument <span class="replace">well</span> you would say i've never had a hamburger and somebody would insist oh you <span class="replace">must have</span> had <span class="replace">me</span> at some point and then you had to argue your side yeah definitely it <span class="insert">was it</span> wasn't pretty and of course <span class="delete">you know</span> i had grown up <span class="insert">i mean</span> just to put this in context for a second if you don't mind <span class="replace">i mean</span> not only had i had hundreds of hamburgers and gone to the mcdonald's <span class="replace">drive through</span> hundreds of times but the counterpoint situation that i always think about when i remember this time is that when i was a senior in high school my family for sort of <span class="replace">time saving</span> reasons decided that a great thing to do would be to go to arby's roast beef i don't know if you have those <span class="replace">on</span> chicago i think they're <span class="replace">country wide</span> so my dad and i would go to arby's on say like a thursday afternoon or something <span class="insert">or you</span> after i got out of school <span class="delete">and</span> we would go in there and we would buy 48 <span class="replace">rvs</span> roast beef sandwiches and they would put them in this cardboard box and we would bring home this giant box full of those <span class="replace">tin foil covered rvs</span> roast beef sandwiches and we would stuff them in our freezer we would freeze the <span class="replace">rvs</span> roast beef sandwiches and then we would have them there buns and all buns and all yeah and so we would have them there as <span class="replace">ready made</span> snacks whenever we <span class="replace">went out like</span> i mean that's the kind of <span class="replace">mediating</span> that my family was engaged <span class="replace">yeah</span> the other thing was that i had these runins with doubting my british identity <span class="delete">like</span> oh really yeah as though it were slipping away and i would really go nuts at that point and there was one time it <span class="replace">would happen</span> at home i was at home and i was like oh my god i <span class="insert">just you know i</span> have to do something i have to affirm my devotion so i think i well i know i opened up the window and i psyched myself to do it i was like oh man if i don't do this <span class="insert">like</span> it won't come back and i opened up the window and then i screamed this is the middle of the night or <span class="replace">10</span> at night i screamed i love england <span class="insert">outside the</span> and of course in a british accent outside the window and then you felt better you felt like you had <span class="replace">reassured</span> yourself i felt like i had done something at least for england yeah i had fortified my britishness i would find myself in these conversations where people were saying you know you've never had a mcdonald's hamburger what kind of <span class="insert">american</span> 18yearold american has never had a hamburger from mcdonald's quite a legitimate question i would add absolutely absolutely and i would say yeah <span class="insert">you know</span> i've just never had one they scare me and i would sort of like talk about the ways <span class="insert">and</span> i would make up these stories about how i'd come close a couple of times how <span class="insert">my friend</span> a friend of mine in high school had bought me a big mac and there i was sitting on the front seat of his car <span class="delete">and</span> i almost ate it and <span class="delete">then</span> couldn't bring myself to do it <span class="insert">and</span> so yeah there was all <span class="replace">the</span> sort of drama <span class="insert">that i am well</span> that i lied about my mom and dad came down to <span class="insert">him came down to</span> visit for <span class="replace">parents</span> weekend and they were really proud that i was going there and really excited to come down and they came down to visit <span class="replace">i'm</span> really proud because you were the first generation to go to college <span class="insert">you'd be</span> right <span class="delete">you made it</span> into this ivy league school it was a big big deal right exactly exactly and so they drove down from <span class="replace">camilleus</span> which is about <span class="delete">between an hour and</span> an hour and a half they came down and in that week leading up to <span class="replace">parents</span> weekend everybody's talking about their parents coming and everybody's making reservations at restaurants where to eat on saturday night and everybody's sort of planning on taking their parents to the football game on saturday during the day and it suddenly occurred to me this real sort of panic set in that <span class="delete">you know</span> my parents would come down and we would go to a football game and my dad would buy a hot dog and <span class="insert">in</span> somebody across the field would see mr lovell eating a hot dog and <span class="delete">then</span> of course the cat would be out of the bag and so i thought you know i've got to make a reservation at a restaurant at <span class="replace">some place</span> either a where nobody else's parents will be or at a vegetarian restaurant and so what i did was make a reservation at the moosewood restaurant which is in ithaca <span class="replace">you know</span> there's <span class="insert">that</span> the moosewood cookbooks that are out <span class="insert">and</span> vegetarian cookbooks exactly <span class="delete">yeah</span> and it's this nice little vegetarian restaurant in <span class="replace">yathaka in</span> a slightly famous place but then we got there and i remember sitting down at the table in the moosewood and the bowls are these kind of carved wooden bowls and <span class="delete">i mean</span> everything about it feels like well like a vegetarian restaurant <span class="replace">and</span> just a vegetarian restaurant but kind of a cartoon of a vegetarian restaurant exactly exactly and i was looking at my parents across the table and they were <span class="delete">sort of</span> dressed up and they were excited to be coming down and i could tell my dad was sitting there and sort of perusing the menu and thinking well <span class="delete">you know</span> maybe this lentil salad will be good or whatever and i could tell <span class="replace">you what's in</span> there thinking <span class="replace">you know jeez</span> i just drove an hour and a half all i want is a steak and a baked potato and a beer <span class="insert">you know</span> and there i was bringing them here <span class="insert">and</span> but they were so game about it they were so sort of willing to go along with it because for some reason they thought i really wanted to bring them there and i just thought <span class="replace">jeez you know</span> these people my parents <span class="insert">you know</span> have really <span class="insert">like</span> given up a lot for me to come there i mean financially they were really stretching themselves and we were taking out all sorts of loans you know all those things that people do in order to go to college and they never complained once about doing it and they just wanted to come down and see me there and feel proud that i was there and i was sort of hiding them out in this vegetarian restaurant <span class="insert">and</span> i felt so bad about it afterwards and they never once complained <span class="delete">and</span> they went home and <span class="insert">i imagine they</span> sort of <span class="replace">imagined and</span> stopping at a <span class="replace">hearty is</span> just outside of <span class="replace">it the good if you're</span> getting a <span class="replace">burn or</span> as soon as they say goodbye but after that i just thought geez <span class="replace">i've</span> got to find some way to come clean about this i mean is it <span class="replace">okay</span> if your child decides to express himself in an alternate personality for a period of two years i think there's <span class="replace">that's</span> funny i never thought i would say this but i think there's nothing wrong with that i never thought i would say it because i <span class="insert">think because i</span> wish that i hadn't done it now but <span class="delete">i don't know</span> maybe i learned something from doing it i mean i think that that is <span class="insert">you know</span> par for the course <span class="insert">like that's part of</span> now i think that's part of growing up <span class="replace">when</span> i think <span class="insert">it was</span> it was probably necessary for me at that time in my life because it gave you more confidence yeah and there was some bridge that this allowed me to cross <span class="replace">joe glovel</span> and sean cole <span class="replace">joe glovel</span> is the executive editor of a podcast company called pineapple street media sean cole works in public radio indeed he does he's one of the producers of our program <span class="insert">that peace of me on your plate but it was murder in this room think about your</span> act <span class="replace">makes me feel an other world that you wouldn't care if we came out you can feel this and that you wouldn't care if we came out about us you're such a cycle</span> act <span class="replace">2</span> conning the con men the american legal system for the most part does not uphold the principle of eye for an eye if <span class="replace">he steals</span> somebody's car the judge does not steal your car in return if <span class="replace">the catcher's</span> selling weed they do not sell weed to you as your punishment but if you're in the business of running scams authorities catch you by running a scam on you this is the story of a con man who made millions by <span class="replace">falling</span> people over the phone until he was the one who got fooled <span class="insert">nancy appdeck reports</span> the guy's name is david diamond that's his actual name he was one of the most successful salesmen in one of the <span class="replace">longest running</span> telemarketing scams in los angeles history david diamond was a salesman at a boiler room this is dale <span class="replace">sikovic</span> he's been a federal trade commission investigator for 29 years he's the one who busted diamond he was living in a very expensive home up in the hills in woodland hills he drove a custom porsche carrera that he had shipped over here by airplane from germany from the factory they lived very high on the hog david diamond was just one of a whole bunch of guys making money hand over fist in an operation in southern california that was basically running the same scam over and over under different names for seven years it was an investment scheme give us your money and we'll put it into this great <span class="replace">900 number</span> business or this online shopping network or this hot new internet service provider needless to say no one ever made a dime except the people running the scam who cleared 40 million since diamond was one of the <span class="replace">operations</span> top salesmen he made 2 million in commissions in just four years on the job he got 30 of whatever he talked <span class="replace">to</span> person into investing that means he personally conned people out of more than 6 million the ftc caught diamond and the others in the operation essentially by conning the con men they had volunteers <span class="replace">posed</span> as <span class="replace">doops</span> and record their phone calls <span class="replace">as</span> the ftc brought a case against the operation diamond worked in some of those recordings are now part of the public record i got dale <span class="replace">sikovic</span> to listen to the tapes with me and talk about david diamond and the fbi volunteer <span class="replace">hukotem</span> the woman on the tape i can't tell you her real name but she uses the alias of marge she assumed the identity of a person who is named marge marge was a real person who we in law enforcement and who people in the telemarketing business refer to as a mooch a mooch is someone who <span class="delete">will</span> essentially buy anything from anybody who calls her on the telephone and in fact she did over a number of years she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars the real <span class="replace">march</span> the real <span class="replace">march</span> spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on bogus prize promotions investments gold coins you name it so the fbi went to marge and said we really think that we need to take your telephone number away from you because it's being used to ruin your life so once marge agreed to that her telephone number was installed in the home of an fbi volunteer <span class="insert">and that volunteer</span> every time that phone line rang the <span class="replace">march</span> line that volunteer would pick up that telephone and answer it and pose as <span class="replace">march march</span> yes <span class="delete">it's</span> david diamond <span class="replace">tell where you</span> are <span class="replace">oh</span> i'm <span class="replace">okay i'm wrong</span> here yeah i sent you off a video and <span class="replace">i packed it</span> yes i have it <span class="replace">okay</span> the video is with <span class="replace">regards</span> to mark <span class="replace">erickson uhhuh</span> mark <span class="replace">erickson</span> is the person who is heading up the program <span class="insert">yes</span> and he is very successful in taking upstart companies and making them successful you've probably heard of hard copy <span class="replace">you know for the</span> original producer of hard copy <span class="replace">i've</span> heard of it yes <span class="replace">okay</span> you're smiling as you listen to this what are you smiling about well i'm smiling because <span class="insert">i</span> it's been a while since i've heard <span class="insert">of</span> marge and she sounds so old and so fragile and such an easy mark when in fact you know she's this sharp fbi informant she doesn't look as old as she sounds trust me so that's one aspect of it the other aspect is this whole mark <span class="replace">erickson</span> thing yeah is he a real person mark <span class="replace">erickson</span> is a real person he was named in our lawsuit and was he an original producer of hard copy no he was a segment producer and <span class="replace">on the air</span> reporter for hard copy for a brief period of time and i mean is this sort of typical of the cons <span class="replace">and</span> the tapes that you've heard that they'll try to associate what they're selling with a legitimate business or organization or television show something that people have heard of exactly they <span class="replace">wanna</span> make this yeah something people can relate to here's the thing you have to invest everything you've got or do nothing at all and i'll say that again you should invest everything you have you should transfer all of your investments into this program or do nothing it doesn't make sense to do just a little bit you should think about doing <span class="replace">a</span> million <span class="insert">dollars</span> in this program oh i don't know that's a lot of money you need to liquidate every nickel you've got you <span class="insert">don't want to be in the situation you</span> either want to be in <span class="replace">the</span> situation wholeheartedly and upgrade your investments or you don't my <span class="replace">strategy</span> is <span class="replace">to</span> do the whole thing well i would never liquidate everything i have my question is why not because there's always <span class="replace">gimbals and</span> anything like this anything like what well any investment like this like this <span class="delete">what does that mean</span> well anything <span class="replace">invested and</span> there's always a gamble now i want to ask you you told me once that you thought he sounded nervous on this tape and in this part where she's saying you know an investment like this and he's sort of <span class="insert">you know</span> questioning her well what do you mean like this i wonder do you have any sense that <span class="replace">he's</span> suspicious that she might know what he's up to i mean do they know that volunteers are out there trying to trap them posing as <span class="replace">doops</span> no since we talked about this tape last <span class="delete">i</span> actually <span class="replace">so to have</span> a revelation <span class="replace">it</span> came to me as to why i listened to over 40 individual tapes of david diamond conversations with marge and conversations with others over the course of about a year and one of the things when you've listened to all of them you find that david in <span class="insert">sort of the early</span> the earlier part of that year was much more kind of sweet and cautious and trying to bond with these women and patient and sometimes would spend an hour on the phone with them the tape would be an hour long but this tape was made towards the very end of that year period probably within a week or two of our raid having gone in on the raid and searched david diamond's desk that day i came to realize that david diamond was starting to question whether he wanted to do this anymore he was starting to really have some concerns about moral concerns <span class="delete">moral concerns</span> about what they were doing and i believe that in these last couple of weeks <span class="replace">that</span> it's kind of shown in this tape he was becoming a little bit desperate he wanted to make a couple <span class="insert">of</span> more big hits and he just couldn't figure out why this woman wasn't <span class="replace">gonna</span> write him a check so he started getting frustrated and it comes out in his voice what evidence did you see that he was starting to have moral qualms about what he was doing david had become a born again there were religious <span class="replace">tracks</span> all over his office and posters on his wall just recently i don't know exactly what the time frame was we do know that he had given a lot of the money that he had made to his church and we believe that a lot of that was sort of a selfimposed penance that he could justify what he was doing because he was giving <span class="delete">he</span> was tithing this money that he was taking from these poor victims into his church <span class="replace">he has</span> 30000 <span class="replace">of</span> what you made on every 5000 and <span class="replace">he</span> put 50000 in this program <span class="insert">at 300000 returns</span> that's <span class="replace">where</span> i'm telling you you need to do <span class="replace">a</span> million <span class="insert">dollars</span> in this program <span class="delete">mhm</span> i don't know i would never put that much in any program do you have an obligation to yourself as an investor to make the most amount of money possible well you know at my age it's really not that <span class="replace">uh where am i going</span> to say i have enough to live on <span class="replace">if you</span> rest <span class="replace">in</span> my life i understand <span class="replace">plus</span> is it still in your best interest to make the most amount of money possible if you could <span class="replace">try to</span> do it as safely as possible <span class="insert">um</span> it's my obligation not to lose what i have <span class="replace">so when i had arrest for the bulk of</span> your obligation to keep your money working for <span class="replace">it a lot of work at</span> the point when i heard this part of the tape even though i knew that <span class="insert">this woman</span> this particular woman was not getting conned that she was in fact conning him and trapping him i started to get so angry because i was thinking you know he is really trying to take all of this old woman's money all of it she's saying i have enough to live on he's saying you have an obligation to make more do you ever hear things like that and just get angry even though you know that she's sort of in on the con on the joke every time i hear these pitches i'm outraged because i am the person that spoke to <span class="replace">people</span> people who really did send david diamond tens of thousands of dollars that consisted of their life savings and now don't have any money to even buy groceries i've interviewed them i've seen them sob yeah it makes me very angry and what sort of recourse do they have <span class="insert">uh swim and then</span> slim and <span class="delete">none slim and none</span> we have public companies that want to take you public <span class="delete">so</span> if you've got a public company <span class="replace">past</span> judgment on <span class="replace">the meeting</span> talking anymore if mark <span class="replace">iris the one</span> to do <span class="replace">this</span> with you <span class="replace">don't</span> even <span class="replace">be</span> talking anymore you <span class="replace">can be able</span> to make an absolute fortune and it doesn't make sense not to have every nickel you've got in <span class="replace">the</span> particular program that's why i said <span class="replace">if</span> emergency investment situation <span class="delete">and</span> you should do at least <span class="replace">50 to</span> 150 units while you have the opportunity <span class="delete">mhm</span> well how much are you investing in this i'm not investing anything in this my investment comes in the time that i put with my client yes right <span class="replace">in</span> the fact that when they make money they reinvest with me right <span class="insert">uhhuh</span> that's the whole point uhhuh you were smiling again when she said <span class="delete">you know</span> how much are you investing <span class="delete">i mean</span> is she just screwing around with him of course she's playing with him <span class="delete">yeah i mean</span> she's trained to ask him those kinds of questions so that he responds with a misrepresentation but that doesn't sound like it's part of the script that just sounds like her being mean <span class="replace">and</span> sort of a delicious way well no i think what we were trying to do or her handler was trying to do was <span class="insert">get her to make</span> to get him to say oh yeah <span class="insert">i've got</span> i'm in it and i've got my <span class="insert">my</span> mother and my grandmother in it <span class="insert">and</span> and i'm putting away money for my child's education with it because then we could show later that he hadn't did you ever <span class="insert">did you ever</span> talk to marge about what it's like to <span class="insert">to</span> do this <span class="insert">do they ever</span> i mean do they ever sort of have fun <span class="delete">just thinking</span> i'm just turning the tables on this guy he has no idea i wish i could answer the question i've never spoken to them i'd love to get the answer to that <span class="delete">myself</span> i'd like to ask that question myself i think they get a lot of personal satisfaction though how often do you get a chance to catch a bad guy as just a regular civilian yeah exactly you know i do it too i <span class="replace">take</span> people using an alias in cases that i work and is it fun i love it i love to get these people to tell me stuff <span class="insert">it's</span> you know it's like acting there's a rush the rush of a con the pleasure of it is knowing that you have more power than the person <span class="replace">your</span> conning you know more you know that it's a con and let's face it given the choice between being the mark and being the con man nobody's going to choose to be the mark but the problem is the more confidence you have in your own con the more easily you become a mark yourself con men get taken by other con men all the time there just seems to be something about the particular arrogance of always being on the knowing side of the con that makes for a really really good mark nancy <span class="replace">updeg</span> is one of the producers of our program in the years since we first broadcast this episode today's show is a rerun dale sekovich the ftc investigator who busted david diamond has died coming up a child tries to fix his own family by harnessing the

class="replace">foeing</span> themselves sometimes that is a side effect of trying to fool others sometimes they just don't know better and pin their hopes and beliefs on something that is simply not true at all <span class="delete">act three oedipus hex</span> we've arrived at <span class="delete">act</span> three of our show act three <span class="replace">adipis</span> hex shalom auslander tells <span class="replace">this</span> story which happened to him when he was a boy <span class="replace">i'm</span> one of those ultra orthodox jewish religious schools called <span class="replace">yashivas i wanted to listen to</span> that although this story is about a little boy in the story the dad is not so nice to his kids which might not be a thing that little kids will enjoy hearing at all so take that under <span class="insert">your</span> advisement here's shalom rabbi breyer walked into our <span class="replace">third grade</span> classroom hung up his long black coat took off his big black hat and handed each student a small black booklet entitled the guide to blessings we had one week he told us to prepare for the annual <span class="replace">yashiva</span> of spring valley blessing <span class="replace">bay</span> my heart <span class="replace">leapt</span> this was just what my mother needed the blessing <span class="replace">be</span> would make her forget all the troubles of our home to have a son who's a <span class="replace">talma khacham a y</span> student that was the ultimate her brother was a respected rabbi and if <span class="replace">our</span> husband couldn't be one well maybe her son could be the guide to blessings was a <span class="replace">70page long</span> listing of hundreds of different foods soups breads fish desserts i flipped through it slowly realizing the size of the challenge that lay ahead <span class="replace">laughful</span> herring eggplant <span class="replace">parmesan</span> i had my work cut out for me <span class="delete">friday afternoons the yeshiva closed early so that we could all rush home to help our parents prepare for shabbos the sabbath rabbi breyer told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that the preparation for shabbos is equal to the importance of shabbos itself most of my preparations involved searching the house for kosher wine and pouring it down the toilet it was a thankless job i admitted to nobody my father's frustrated rage at not having his manischewitz concord grape was fearsome but it was far better than his drunken rage if he did have it i'd search the pantry i'd search the garage i'd search my father's closet but i was only eight years old and there was always a bottle of kedem hiding somewhere i just hadn't thought to check that night my father drunk on a bottle of blush chablis that got away grabbed my older brother by his shirt collar and dragged him away from the shabbos table he dragged him all the way down the stairs to our bedroom in the basement and slammed the door shut even the silverware jumped who wants the last matzoh ball my mother asked i made extra when my brother returned to the table his nose was bleeding my mother brought him a can of frozen orange juice to hold against the back of his neck which was supposed to somehow stop the bleeding rabbi breyer taught us that it is prohibited to defrost orange juice on shabbos because changing food from solid to liquid is considered cooking and cooking is considered working and even god refrained from working on shabbos there are 39 different categories of work that are prohibited on shabbos that's also why you're not allowed to switch on lights on shabbos the electricity causes the filament to glow which is considered burning which is considered working category number two my father came back to the table and drunkenly sang a few shabbos songs fudging the words and banging heavily on the table with his fist i sat hunched over absentmindedly drawing circles on the condensation that had formed on the silver water pitcher my father slapped my hand shabbos he shouted writing category number five eventually he stumbled off to his bedroom and fell asleep snoring loudly we sat in the dining room and picked glumly at our food the following monday morning as we all sat studying from our blessing books there was a knock on rabbi breyer's classroom door and rabbi greenbaum the yeshiva principal solemnly entered we all rose the two rabbis conferred quietly for a moment before signaling us all to be seated after a few thoughtful strokes of his long black beard rabbi greenbaum sighed deeply and informed us that the night before our classmate avrumi gruenembaum's father had suffered a heart attack and died some kids have all the luck blessed is the one true judge said rabbi breyer nodding his head blessed is the one true judge we all answered nodding our heads i wondered what mr gruenembaum might have done to deserve death did he bow down to idols did he walk four steps without his yarmulke on whatever it was it must have been pretty bad as rabbi greenbaum turned to leave he paused and with a stern shake of his finger reminded us all that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that until the age of 13 all of a boy's sins are ascribed to his father i turned to look at avrumi's empty chair avrumi was a chubby kid with heavy orthodontia and foul breath but a sudden respect for him grew inside me i wondered what he might have done to cause his father's death whatever it was it must have been pretty bad scowling fiercely rabbi greenbaum advised each and every one of us to pray to hashem the holy one blessed be he for forgiveness so that he wouldn't kill our fathers too my heart leaped blessed is hashem he said blessed is hashem we answered blessed is hashem was right all of a sudden i had two ways i could save my family i could win the blessing bee for my mother or i could sin so much hashem would have to kill my father courageous avrumi gruenembaum maybe one shabbos night he had switched on a light maybe he drank milk after eating meat maybe he touched himself that night just before bed i ate a drumstick washed it down with some milk touched myself and flicked the bedroom light on and off break those lights and i'll break your hands my father shouted it was going to be a busy week the blessing bee worked the same way as a spelling bee there are six basic blessings on food hamotzei the blessing for bread mezonos the blessing for wheat hagofen the blessing for wine or grape juice haeitz the blessing for things that grow from trees hoadamah the blessing for things that grow from the earth and shehakol the blessing for everything else bagel hamotzei oatmeal mezonos gefilte fish shehakol the blessing for everything else but that was the easy part things became much more complicated when you started combining foods some foods are superior to other foods and in combination with subordinate foods the superior food gets the blessing to make matters worse some blessings are superior to other blessings and you had to know which blessing to recite first this is where they separated the men from the goys spaghetti and meatballs mezonos the wheat blessing then shehakol the everything else blessing cereal with milk shehakol for the milk then mezonos for the wheat in the cereal twix the chocolate candy with the cookie crunch trick question twix isn't kosher i spent the next week sinning and blessing and blessing and sinning alternately praising god and then defying him as much as one eightyearold possibly could monday morning i stuffed myself i had a bowl of fruity pebbles mezonos a slice of toast hamotzei a glass of juice shehakol half an apple haeitz and a couple of old french fries i found at the bottom of the fridge hoadamah one meal five blessings tuesday i touched myself i also partook of bread without first ceremoniously washing my hands and that evening before going to sleep i sat on the edge of my bed and carefully recited and ass a dozen times each my father banged angrily on my bedroom door lights out he barked i smiled for you and me both pal wednesday i stole 5 from my mother and didn't recite any blessings at all on the bag full of candy that i bought with it a charleston chew which is traif to begin with and a chunky which would have been a shehakol if i weren't trying to kill my father a chunky with raisins shehakol then haeitz</span> thursday i didn't wear <span class="replace">titsess</span> rabbi breyer noticed that the strings weren't dangling from my sides and grabbed me by the ear and pulled me to the front of the class speak to the children of israel he quoted loudly from the torah as he <span class="replace">spank</span> me hard on my bottom and tell them to make <span class="replace">titsus</span> on the corners of their garments that afternoon after not respecting my elders by taking <span class="replace">up</span> the garbage like my mother had told me to i touched myself and silently begged god to just this once credit those sins to rabbi breyer's account later i defiled a prayer book by carrying it into the bathroom the blessing bee was the following morning and i could barely sleep <span class="replace">mental</span> soup <span class="replace">mizonos</span> potato <span class="replace">khnish khadamak</span> root beer is it a root is it a beer ass bitch i tossed and turned i blessed and cursed and finally i fell into an uncomfortable <span class="replace">slew</span> after a week at home <span class="replace">a vromeg runabam</span> conveniently returned to school just in time for the blessing bee it was all i could do to not lean over and ask him how he did it psst <span class="replace">a vrami</span> tell me was it lobster did you eat lobster <span class="replace">but by briar</span> told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that when abraham died hashem comforted isaac we learned from this that it is a tremendous mitzvah or good deed to comfort the bereaved <span class="replace">but by briar</span> instructed us all to line up at <span class="replace">a vrami's</span> desk to shake his hand and recite the traditional <span class="replace">mourners' consolation</span> may <span class="replace">have shem</span> comfort you among the mourners of zion <span class="insert">being</span> just eight years old i wasn't entirely familiar with <span class="replace">shem's</span> system but it occurred to me that along with all my sins my father might also be getting all my mitzvahs i wasn't taking any chances soon it was my turn in line how's it going i said to <span class="replace">rumi where my briar</span> pinched me <span class="replace">how</span> i screamed <span class="replace">shmendra keg rumpled</span> after the last boy had asked <span class="replace">us to come for it of rummy</span> among the mourners of zion <span class="replace">whereby briar</span> smacked his desk loudly the blessing bee began we lined up at the back of the classroom nervously pulling on our <span class="replace">citizens</span> and twirling our <span class="replace">payas</span> the rules were simple name the correct blessing and remain standing for the next round name the wrong blessing and you take your seat <span class="replace">each</span> year's winner <span class="replace">yuka seel's ominy hudish neck</span> stood beside me <span class="replace">healing</span> calmly against the wall mindlessly picking his nose <span class="replace">ouslander</span> shalom called out rabbi breyer i stepped forward apple he shouted apple i called out <span class="replace">hades</span> the blessing for food from trees correct rabbi breyer said the blessing bee usually started off pretty easy david borgen got tuna <span class="replace">shahako</span> the everything else blessing <span class="replace">auri mishinsky</span> got <span class="replace">matsuh hamotsu</span> the blessing for bread and <span class="replace">abitakman</span> got stuck with <span class="replace">cougal</span> which he thought was <span class="replace">adama</span> food from the earth but was really <span class="replace">mizuno's</span> the blessing on wheat three other kids got taken out by oatmeal borscht with sour cream claimed two others and by the end of the first round almost a third of the students were already back in their seats round two <span class="replace">houselander</span> shalom called rabbi breyer i stepped forward mushroom barley soup he shouted mushroom barley soup mushroom barley soup damn i knew i should have studied the chapter on soups more i'd wasted half the week on entrees was it <span class="replace">i'd done</span> on the mushrooms which came from the earth or was it <span class="replace">mizzonos</span> on the barley maybe it was <span class="replace">shahakko</span> the everything else blessing on the soup mushroom barley soup i called out <span class="replace">my zoneos</span> rabbi breyer tugged on his beard his eyes narrowing into angry little slits and <span class="replace">uh shahako</span> i added rabbi breyer triumphantly smacked his desk signaling that i was correct apple <span class="replace">strutal</span> took out david borgen yoel levine and shlomo <span class="replace">pomeran's</span> my friend <span class="replace">mutti</span> greenberg got stuck with cheesecake and i could tell just by the expression on his face that he had absolutely no idea he wisely offered two answers one for thin crust and one for thick and somehow managed to stay alive it was hard to believe this was only round two <span class="replace">a vermi</span> stepped forward i smiled at <span class="replace">mutti avermi</span> may have killed his father but he wasn't very bright and he never did well at these things he was lucky to even be in the second round at all bagel shouted <span class="replace">rev ibreyer</span> bagel i looked at <span class="replace">mutti and</span> disbelief was he kidding bagel bagel called out <span class="replace">of remy hamotsi this was bullsh</span> correct shouted <span class="replace">rev ibreyer</span> very good <span class="replace">the frame green blette of remy</span> epstein and <span class="replace">yowell franco</span> all got out on cholent with barley <span class="replace">in</span> large pieces of meat while chopped liver on <span class="replace">hala</span> with a slice of lettuce and a bit of olive took out four more including <span class="replace">mutti</span> and then there were three it was just <span class="replace">yuka siel's almanuhu to</span> schneck <span class="replace">a remy grunembaum</span> and me round three began <span class="replace">houselander</span> shalom called out rabbi breyer i stepped forward ice cream shouted rabbi breyer in a cone ice cream in a cone ice cream in a cone i knew ice cream but why would he add the cone was there something different if it <span class="replace">wasn't</span> a cone what was an ice cream cone made of anyway was it cake was it a wafer ice cream in a cone rabbi breyer shouted is the ice cream subordinate to the cone or is it the <span class="replace">cone</span> subordinate to the ice cream if it's a sugar cone maybe you really desire the cone ice cream in a cone rabbi breyer shouted again i had no choice ice cream in a cone i called out no blessing everyone in the classroom turned to face me looking back on the whole episode rabbi breyer had really left me no choice no blessing said rabbi breyer why no blessing because i explained nervously twirling my <span class="replace">titsus because</span> because the room smells like <span class="replace">duty</span> there was a long silence <span class="replace">mutted</span> giggled and others followed rabbi breyer slowly rose to his feet his thick fists pushing themselves into the desktop it may have been a loophole but technically speaking i was correct rabbi breyer himself had told us that our sages tell us that the torah tells us that there were three situations in which one is absolutely prohibited from reciting a blessing one while facing a male over the age of nine years old whose genitals are showing two while facing a female over the age of three years old whose genitals are showing and three in the presence of feces frankly given the other two options i think i chose the least offensive answer for a big man rabbi breyer moved pretty quickly it's true i said as he <span class="replace">barrelled</span> toward me the torah says that he grabbed me roughly by my arm lifting me clear off the ground and dragged me towards the door shouting angrily in yiddish the whole time but it smells like <span class="replace">duty</span> i yelled the room smells like <span class="replace">duty</span> wait there's a naked girl in the room there's a naked girl the door slammed shut behind me i stood in the hallway and <span class="replace">rubbed</span> my bruised arm i began to cry the blessing bee was lost i was not a great rabbi <span class="delete">and</span> my father was still not dead i <span class="replace">tipped toad</span> toward the classroom door and listened closely two minutes later <span class="replace">you could see all</span> zalman <span class="replace">yehudasneck</span> fell victim to <span class="replace">matsabri</span> with maple syrup and the last man standing was <span class="replace">a romy grunembao apple's</span> called out <span class="replace">by</span> breyer <span class="replace">apple's of romy</span> answered <span class="replace">h8's muzzle tuff</span> called out <span class="replace">our briar muzzle tuff</span> total bull <span class="insert">b the b the b the b the b the b the b the</span> that night we had the traditional friday night <span class="replace">gfiltefisch shahakul</span> with a little slice of carrot <span class="replace">hadama</span> my father was drunk again singing <span class="replace">shabba</span> songs fudging the words and banging heavily on the table with his fist my mother went into the kitchen and brought out the soup when my brother said he didn't want any my father slapped him pushed him over backward onto the floor and poured the hot chicken soup onto his face my mother took my brother into the bathroom and sat with him on the edge of the bathtub pressing a cold washcloth against his cheeks <span class="insert">and</span> i went back to the dining room to <span class="replace">wipe</span> the chicken soup off the floor chicken soup is a <span class="replace">shahakal</span> even if it is cooked with vegetables since chicken is the dominant taste in the soup <span class="replace">there by</span> breyer told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that the holy one blessed be he sent the egyptians <span class="replace">ten</span> plagues in order to teach us that he gives people many chances to repent and only then if they still continue to sin does he punish them with death i went downstairs to my bedroom took four steps without my <span class="replace">amok</span> on touched
