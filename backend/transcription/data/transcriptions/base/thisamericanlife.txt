parents here is all the evidence that you need the tv is bad for kids especially public tv when sean was 14 he loved watching those british tv shows they're always running on pbs masterpiece theater dr who and then there was this show that i would stay up really late and watch and tape and watch over and over again the tapes called dempsey and makepiece which was about an american detective who went to london because he had been like set up at home and he was teamed up with a woman who was this aristocrat named lady harriet makepiece and i was really on her side you know she's got it going on you looked down on the america oh yeah but you don't like to bet lady harriet makepiece and all the other brits on tv was their or a goofness how they seemed above it all how they looked down on americans which shondit also convinced there must be something wrong with the nation that produced jocks and bullies who harassed him in school and sometimes joking around with his friends you would talk with the british accent and then it was just something that spiraled out of control i know that eventually i was just using an english accent literally from waking to sleeping morning noon and night shantzburg with the british accent from the time he was 14 until he was 16 and at some point his mom thought you know maybe i need to do something about this and took him to see a psychiatrist he was just really he must i don't know you know the different schools of psychology but he was really very confrontive and he was like well you know you've got to stop doing this because you're not british and my mom just sort of sat over next to me and she sort of went yeah to agree with him and to sort of help him in showing me this shah misfurious he had an embole's lecture of the guy on how in fact he was british and the only problem with that was that a he knew very well that he was not and b his mom was sitting right there she was sure to contradict them he didn't know what to do his situation seemed impossible because that's what i was thinking like there has to be a way that i can be british still there must be a way that this is true somehow yeah exactly but at the honor radio program stories of people who tell a lie and they get to the point where they believe the lie more than anybody else does it feels like it must be true so happens all the time and gotta say we are not even gonna get into what happens with political figures in this show kidding themselves about the facts of things today we have stories of civilians people like you and me basically pulling hoaxes on ourselves from wbz chicago it's this american life i'm ira glass like one of our programs today the sun never sets on the moosewood restaurant and which two young men both from small towns try on new identities false identities and what they have to do to keep the lives going act 2 conning the con men nancy update reports on a federal sting operation and how it caught con men by setting up a con of its own act 3 adipis hex a little kid tries to get rid of his own father with a very very unlikely plan let's say we're those act 1 the sun never sets on the moosewood restaurant so this is the story of two young people who for a period in their lives and they're searched to figure out who they were pretended to be people who they were not we're going to hear from sean cole and from joel lovell we're going to start with sean today's show is a rerun this was quoted years ago these days sean is a producer here at our show sean grew up in a small town in massachusetts the town that was approximately 3350 miles from london it was second nature it was first nature it was you know to this day i have trouble saying oh i faked an accent for two years i mean i had an accent for two years so i like sean could i just ask you to take a deep breath and describe for me what you had for lunch today or perhaps for breakfast this morning in as close to the accent that you cannot as close as i can yeah okay i'm gonna take a sip of water here well i had a salad i had it at the boston house of pancakes or a pizza rather what was the beverage it was a snapple just lemon flavoured i don't really like the peach joe lovell's story began when he left the working class town where he grew up in upstate new york his parents owned a liquor store in a small town he was the first member of his family to go to college and it was an especially big deal because he got into an ivy league school quite now it was one of those first days of college you know when he spent a lot of time kind of moves and hordes and you spend a lot of time in each other's dorm rooms and there were about oh i don't know 10 or 11 of us in this one guy's room and we were just like sitting around eating pizza and talking and people were talking about what they're you know where they were from and what their parents did and stuff like that and there was one guy whose dad was a doctor for the knicks there was another guy whose father was an elected representative from new york state and then this other guy whose father was on the world court literally was a member of the world court i'm mine and so it suddenly seemed like this incredibly sort of impressive group to me and they seemed like just sort of worldly in ways that you know there was just beyond my wildest imagination and you know worldly beyond what i am now frankly and i remember sitting there at the time thinking oh my god i'm so out of my league here and then completely unplanned i suddenly said as a slice of pizza was passed i mean this sort of pizza would sausage on top of it i said i can't take that because my parents are vegetarians and everybody in the room turned and looked at me because it wasn't even as if i said well i'm a vegetarian but i said my parents are vegetarians and there's a sort of puzzled look on everybody in the room and i said well you know and i am too i've never eaten meat and i'm not entirely well i mean i have some ideas now about why i said that but at the time i had no idea what i was saying it was like suddenly i'd become possessed and i had to think of something to say about myself that seemed interesting and in vegetarianism was the thing that i chose now did you tell people that you were actually from england no never that i was from britain but in a way that i was british you know there was a real distinction there for me like i you know i'd taken it on like i was culturally british now well i think what it was is i mean i think i did some sort of calculus that took like a nanosecond in my head and i thought i can't actually lie about what my parents do but i think the connections that i was making were this that somehow because i was from this town and the sticks if my folks were vegetarians then the whole history that that suggested was that they were sort of these kind of leftist academic radicals who had sort of dropped out of society and gone back to the land and i was living in this pumpkin town in upstate in new york and my folks were living some sort of life that was driven by their political philosophy rather than i was just a guy who grew up in an upstate in new york you know i did the old kid thing of wishing that my real british parents would come and tell me i was adopted and take me back to london so i'm sitting there in the room and all these guys are looking at me and they're like dude what do you eat and suddenly i realized i realized in that moment little i knew about vegetarianism and i kind of tried to be a real sort of vague about it you know we salads and lentils i remember sort of saying lentils a lot you know and there was a gap certainly in my education because like i would be using you know words that americans just don't use you know i would instead of saying drugstore i would say chemist or you know i would try my best to remember to say you know bonnet instead of hood or boot instead of trunk but i often couldn't on the meal plan i ended up eating a lot of big piles of iceberg lettuce and chickpeas and during that time would you find yourself sneaking to go to get meat somewhere yeah definitely at first i would go really far from campus in order to have like a blt there was this there's this diner downtown in ithaca and it felt incredibly illicit i'd be sitting there and i'd have some reading material or something with me and i'd be the lonely guy in my booth and i would order the blt and i would sort of watch it kind of coming from across the room with its toothpick in the top of it and a side of french fries with this meat gravy on top and it would just you know when it landed on the table it would just seem like this incredibly you know sort of wonderful moment you know when you're doing something just just totally unlike what anybody would expect of you i was nobody you know i mean i was living in a really like extremely small kind of rural town in the middle of nowhere it was i guess in a way like this was my way of traveling you know in a way of being somebody and sort of of achieving an identity which i guess i didn't feel like i had i didn't feel like i'm just sort of realizing this now but i guess i didn't feel as though i had anything that made me up i mean what i realized fairly quickly is that if this is going to be believable i actually have to well i have to believe in it but i also began to not only believe but really sort of take on as my persona all of the stuff that i imagined was associated with vegetarianism so like what well you know certain certain political convictions and ways of dress i wore ripped jeans and i wore combat boots but i also wore like a kind of stage jacket that you would see in a community theater production of hamlet yeah i bought sandals i very specifically remember going down to this thrift store in downtown ithaca and buying a pair of fatigue shorts which just seemed like you know i might as well have been shea guaveira at that point this morning i mean as far as i was concerned i was yeah i was a dangerous leftist did you at any point during this find yourself in the following argument well you would say i've never had a hamburger and somebody would insist oh you must have had me at some point and then you had to argue your side yeah definitely it was it wasn't pretty and of course i had grown up i mean just to put this in context for a second if you don't mind i mean not only had i had hundreds of hamburgers and gone to the mcdonald's drive through hundreds of times but the counterpoint situation that i always think about when i remember this time is that when i was a senior in high school my family for sort of time saving reasons decided that a great thing to do would be to go to arby's roast beef i don't know if you have those on chicago i think they're country wide so my dad and i would go to arby's on say like a thursday afternoon or something or you after i got out of school we would go in there and we would buy 48 rvs roast beef sandwiches and they would put them in this cardboard box and we would bring home this giant box full of those tin foil covered rvs roast beef sandwiches and we would stuff them in our freezer we would freeze the rvs roast beef sandwiches and then we would have them there buns and all buns and all yeah and so we would have them there as ready made snacks whenever we went out like i mean that's the kind of mediating that my family was engaged yeah the other thing was that i had these runins with doubting my british identity oh really yeah as though it were slipping away and i would really go nuts at that point and there was one time it would happen at home i was at home and i was like oh my god i just you know i have to do something i have to affirm my devotion so i think i well i know i opened up the window and i psyched myself to do it i was like oh man if i don't do this like it won't come back and i opened up the window and then i screamed this is the middle of the night or 10 at night i screamed i love england outside the and of course in a british accent outside the window and then you felt better you felt like you had reassured yourself i felt like i had done something at least for england yeah i had fortified my britishness i would find myself in these conversations where people were saying you know you've never had a mcdonald's hamburger what kind of american 18yearold american has never had a hamburger from mcdonald's quite a legitimate question i would add absolutely absolutely and i would say yeah you know i've just never had one they scare me and i would sort of like talk about the ways and i would make up these stories about how i'd come close a couple of times how my friend a friend of mine in high school had bought me a big mac and there i was sitting on the front seat of his car i almost ate it and couldn't bring myself to do it and so yeah there was all the sort of drama that i am well that i lied about my mom and dad came down to him came down to visit for parents weekend and they were really proud that i was going there and really excited to come down and they came down to visit i'm really proud because you were the first generation to go to college you'd be right into this ivy league school it was a big big deal right exactly exactly and so they drove down from camilleus which is about an hour and a half they came down and in that week leading up to parents weekend everybody's talking about their parents coming and everybody's making reservations at restaurants where to eat on saturday night and everybody's sort of planning on taking their parents to the football game on saturday during the day and it suddenly occurred to me this real sort of panic set in that my parents would come down and we would go to a football game and my dad would buy a hot dog and in somebody across the field would see mr lovell eating a hot dog and of course the cat would be out of the bag and so i thought you know i've got to make a reservation at a restaurant at some place either a where nobody else's parents will be or at a vegetarian restaurant and so what i did was make a reservation at the moosewood restaurant which is in ithaca you know there's that the moosewood cookbooks that are out and vegetarian cookbooks exactly and it's this nice little vegetarian restaurant in yathaka in a slightly famous place but then we got there and i remember sitting down at the table in the moosewood and the bowls are these kind of carved wooden bowls and everything about it feels like well like a vegetarian restaurant and just a vegetarian restaurant but kind of a cartoon of a vegetarian restaurant exactly exactly and i was looking at my parents across the table and they were dressed up and they were excited to be coming down and i could tell my dad was sitting there and sort of perusing the menu and thinking well maybe this lentil salad will be good or whatever and i could tell you what's in there thinking you know jeez i just drove an hour and a half all i want is a steak and a baked potato and a beer you know and there i was bringing them here and but they were so game about it they were so sort of willing to go along with it because for some reason they thought i really wanted to bring them there and i just thought jeez you know these people my parents you know have really like given up a lot for me to come there i mean financially they were really stretching themselves and we were taking out all sorts of loans you know all those things that people do in order to go to college and they never complained once about doing it and they just wanted to come down and see me there and feel proud that i was there and i was sort of hiding them out in this vegetarian restaurant and i felt so bad about it afterwards and they never once complained they went home and i imagine they sort of imagined and stopping at a hearty is just outside of it the good if you're getting a burn or as soon as they say goodbye but after that i just thought geez i've got to find some way to come clean about this i mean is it okay if your child decides to express himself in an alternate personality for a period of two years i think there's that's funny i never thought i would say this but i think there's nothing wrong with that i never thought i would say it because i think because i wish that i hadn't done it now but maybe i learned something from doing it i mean i think that that is you know par for the course like that's part of now i think that's part of growing up when i think it was it was probably necessary for me at that time in my life because it gave you more confidence yeah and there was some bridge that this allowed me to cross joe glovel and sean cole joe glovel is the executive editor of a podcast company called pineapple street media sean cole works in public radio indeed he does he's one of the producers of our program that peace of me on your plate but it was murder in this room think about your act makes me feel an other world that you wouldn't care if we came out you can feel this and that you wouldn't care if we came out about us you're such a cycle act 2 conning the con men the american legal system for the most part does not uphold the principle of eye for an eye if he steals somebody's car the judge does not steal your car in return if the catcher's selling weed they do not sell weed to you as your punishment but if you're in the business of running scams authorities catch you by running a scam on you this is the story of a con man who made millions by falling people over the phone until he was the one who got fooled nancy appdeck reports the guy's name is david diamond that's his actual name he was one of the most successful salesmen in one of the longest running telemarketing scams in los angeles history david diamond was a salesman at a boiler room this is dale sikovic he's been a federal trade commission investigator for 29 years he's the one who busted diamond he was living in a very expensive home up in the hills in woodland hills he drove a custom porsche carrera that he had shipped over here by airplane from germany from the factory they lived very high on the hog david diamond was just one of a whole bunch of guys making money hand over fist in an operation in southern california that was basically running the same scam over and over under different names for seven years it was an investment scheme give us your money and we'll put it into this great 900 number business or this online shopping network or this hot new internet service provider needless to say no one ever made a dime except the people running the scam who cleared 40 million since diamond was one of the operations top salesmen he made 2 million in commissions in just four years on the job he got 30 of whatever he talked to person into investing that means he personally conned people out of more than 6 million the ftc caught diamond and the others in the operation essentially by conning the con men they had volunteers posed as doops and record their phone calls as the ftc brought a case against the operation diamond worked in some of those recordings are now part of the public record i got dale sikovic to listen to the tapes with me and talk about david diamond and the fbi volunteer hukotem the woman on the tape i can't tell you her real name but she uses the alias of marge she assumed the identity of a person who is named marge marge was a real person who we in law enforcement and who people in the telemarketing business refer to as a mooch a mooch is someone who essentially buy anything from anybody who calls her on the telephone and in fact she did over a number of years she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars the real march the real march spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on bogus prize promotions investments gold coins you name it so the fbi went to marge and said we really think that we need to take your telephone number away from you because it's being used to ruin your life so once marge agreed to that her telephone number was installed in the home of an fbi volunteer and that volunteer every time that phone line rang the march line that volunteer would pick up that telephone and answer it and pose as march march yes david diamond tell where you are oh i'm okay i'm wrong here yeah i sent you off a video and i packed it yes i have it okay the video is with regards to mark erickson uhhuh mark erickson is the person who is heading up the program yes and he is very successful in taking upstart companies and making them successful you've probably heard of hard copy you know for the original producer of hard copy i've heard of it yes okay you're smiling as you listen to this what are you smiling about well i'm smiling because i it's been a while since i've heard of marge and she sounds so old and so fragile and such an easy mark when in fact you know she's this sharp fbi informant she doesn't look as old as she sounds trust me so that's one aspect of it the other aspect is this whole mark erickson thing yeah is he a real person mark erickson is a real person he was named in our lawsuit and was he an original producer of hard copy no he was a segment producer and on the air reporter for hard copy for a brief period of time and i mean is this sort of typical of the cons and the tapes that you've heard that they'll try to associate what they're selling with a legitimate business or organization or television show something that people have heard of exactly they wanna make this yeah something people can relate to here's the thing you have to invest everything you've got or do nothing at all and i'll say that again you should invest everything you have you should transfer all of your investments into this program or do nothing it doesn't make sense to do just a little bit you should think about doing a million dollars in this program oh i don't know that's a lot of money you need to liquidate every nickel you've got you don't want to be in the situation you either want to be in the situation wholeheartedly and upgrade your investments or you don't my strategy is to do the whole thing well i would never liquidate everything i have my question is why not because there's always gimbals and anything like this anything like what well any investment like this like this well anything invested and there's always a gamble now i want to ask you you told me once that you thought he sounded nervous on this tape and in this part where she's saying you know an investment like this and he's sort of you know questioning her well what do you mean like this i wonder do you have any sense that he's suspicious that she might know what he's up to i mean do they know that volunteers are out there trying to trap them posing as doops no since we talked about this tape last actually so to have a revelation it came to me as to why i listened to over 40 individual tapes of david diamond conversations with marge and conversations with others over the course of about a year and one of the things when you've listened to all of them you find that david in sort of the early the earlier part of that year was much more kind of sweet and cautious and trying to bond with these women and patient and sometimes would spend an hour on the phone with them the tape would be an hour long but this tape was made towards the very end of that year period probably within a week or two of our raid having gone in on the raid and searched david diamond's desk that day i came to realize that david diamond was starting to question whether he wanted to do this anymore he was starting to really have some concerns about moral concerns about what they were doing and i believe that in these last couple of weeks that it's kind of shown in this tape he was becoming a little bit desperate he wanted to make a couple of more big hits and he just couldn't figure out why this woman wasn't gonna write him a check so he started getting frustrated and it comes out in his voice what evidence did you see that he was starting to have moral qualms about what he was doing david had become a born again there were religious tracks all over his office and posters on his wall just recently i don't know exactly what the time frame was we do know that he had given a lot of the money that he had made to his church and we believe that a lot of that was sort of a selfimposed penance that he could justify what he was doing because he was giving was tithing this money that he was taking from these poor victims into his church he has 30000 of what you made on every 5000 and he put 50000 in this program at 300000 returns that's where i'm telling you you need to do a million dollars in this program i don't know i would never put that much in any program do you have an obligation to yourself as an investor to make the most amount of money possible well you know at my age it's really not that uh where am i going to say i have enough to live on if you rest in my life i understand plus is it still in your best interest to make the most amount of money possible if you could try to do it as safely as possible um it's my obligation not to lose what i have so when i had arrest for the bulk of your obligation to keep your money working for it a lot of work at the point when i heard this part of the tape even though i knew that this woman this particular woman was not getting conned that she was in fact conning him and trapping him i started to get so angry because i was thinking you know he is really trying to take all of this old woman's money all of it she's saying i have enough to live on he's saying you have an obligation to make more do you ever hear things like that and just get angry even though you know that she's sort of in on the con on the joke every time i hear these pitches i'm outraged because i am the person that spoke to people people who really did send david diamond tens of thousands of dollars that consisted of their life savings and now don't have any money to even buy groceries i've interviewed them i've seen them sob yeah it makes me very angry and what sort of recourse do they have uh swim and then slim and we have public companies that want to take you public if you've got a public company past judgment on the meeting talking anymore if mark iris the one to do this with you don't even be talking anymore you can be able to make an absolute fortune and it doesn't make sense not to have every nickel you've got in the particular program that's why i said if emergency investment situation you should do at least 50 to 150 units while you have the opportunity well how much are you investing in this i'm not investing anything in this my investment comes in the time that i put with my client yes right in the fact that when they make money they reinvest with me right uhhuh that's the whole point uhhuh you were smiling again when she said how much are you investing is she just screwing around with him of course she's playing with him she's trained to ask him those kinds of questions so that he responds with a misrepresentation but that doesn't sound like it's part of the script that just sounds like her being mean and sort of a delicious way well no i think what we were trying to do or her handler was trying to do was get her to make to get him to say oh yeah i've got i'm in it and i've got my my mother and my grandmother in it and and i'm putting away money for my child's education with it because then we could show later that he hadn't did you ever did you ever talk to marge about what it's like to to do this do they ever i mean do they ever sort of have fun i'm just turning the tables on this guy he has no idea i wish i could answer the question i've never spoken to them i'd love to get the answer to that i'd like to ask that question myself i think they get a lot of personal satisfaction though how often do you get a chance to catch a bad guy as just a regular civilian yeah exactly you know i do it too i take people using an alias in cases that i work and is it fun i love it i love to get these people to tell me stuff it's you know it's like acting there's a rush the rush of a con the pleasure of it is knowing that you have more power than the person your conning you know more you know that it's a con and let's face it given the choice between being the mark and being the con man nobody's going to choose to be the mark but the problem is the more confidence you have in your own con the more easily you become a mark yourself con men get taken by other con men all the time there just seems to be something about the particular arrogance of always being on the knowing side of the con that makes for a really really good mark nancy updeg is one of the producers of our program in the years since we first broadcast this episode today's show is a rerun dale sekovich the ftc investigator who busted david diamond has died coming up a child tries to fix his own family by harnessing the most powerful force that exists anywhere that's in a minute and chicago bubble gradyo when our program continues it's american life america i see each week in our program of course you choose a theme bringing you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme today show hoaxing yourself stories of people who are foeing themselves sometimes that is a side effect of trying to fool others sometimes they just don't know better and pin their hopes and beliefs on something that is simply not true at all we've arrived at three of our show act three adipis hex shalom auslander tells this story which happened to him when he was a boy i'm one of those ultra orthodox jewish religious schools called yashivas i wanted to listen to that although this story is about a little boy in the story the dad is not so nice to his kids which might not be a thing that little kids will enjoy hearing at all so take that under your advisement here's shalom rabbi breyer walked into our third grade classroom hung up his long black coat took off his big black hat and handed each student a small black booklet entitled the guide to blessings we had one week he told us to prepare for the annual yashiva of spring valley blessing bay my heart leapt this was just what my mother needed the blessing be would make her forget all the troubles of our home to have a son who's a talma khacham a y student that was the ultimate her brother was a respected rabbi and if our husband couldn't be one well maybe her son could be the guide to blessings was a 70page long listing of hundreds of different foods soups breads fish desserts i flipped through it slowly realizing the size of the challenge that lay ahead laughful herring eggplant parmesan i had my work cut out for me thursday i didn't wear titsess rabbi breyer noticed that the strings weren't dangling from my sides and grabbed me by the ear and pulled me to the front of the class speak to the children of israel he quoted loudly from the torah as he spank me hard on my bottom and tell them to make titsus on the corners of their garments that afternoon after not respecting my elders by taking up the garbage like my mother had told me to i touched myself and silently begged god to just this once credit those sins to rabbi breyer's account later i defiled a prayer book by carrying it into the bathroom the blessing bee was the following morning and i could barely sleep mental soup mizonos potato khnish khadamak root beer is it a root is it a beer ass bitch i tossed and turned i blessed and cursed and finally i fell into an uncomfortable slew after a week at home a vromeg runabam conveniently returned to school just in time for the blessing bee it was all i could do to not lean over and ask him how he did it psst a vrami tell me was it lobster did you eat lobster but by briar told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that when abraham died hashem comforted isaac we learned from this that it is a tremendous mitzvah or good deed to comfort the bereaved but by briar instructed us all to line up at a vrami's desk to shake his hand and recite the traditional mourners' consolation may have shem comfort you among the mourners of zion being just eight years old i wasn't entirely familiar with shem's system but it occurred to me that along with all my sins my father might also be getting all my mitzvahs i wasn't taking any chances soon it was my turn in line how's it going i said to rumi where my briar pinched me how i screamed shmendra keg rumpled after the last boy had asked us to come for it of rummy among the mourners of zion whereby briar smacked his desk loudly the blessing bee began we lined up at the back of the classroom nervously pulling on our citizens and twirling our payas the rules were simple name the correct blessing and remain standing for the next round name the wrong blessing and you take your seat each year's winner yuka seel's ominy hudish neck stood beside me healing calmly against the wall mindlessly picking his nose ouslander shalom called out rabbi breyer i stepped forward apple he shouted apple i called out hades the blessing for food from trees correct rabbi breyer said the blessing bee usually started off pretty easy david borgen got tuna shahako the everything else blessing auri mishinsky got matsuh hamotsu the blessing for bread and abitakman got stuck with cougal which he thought was adama food from the earth but was really mizuno's the blessing on wheat three other kids got taken out by oatmeal borscht with sour cream claimed two others and by the end of the first round almost a third of the students were already back in their seats round two houselander shalom called rabbi breyer i stepped forward mushroom barley soup he shouted mushroom barley soup mushroom barley soup damn i knew i should have studied the chapter on soups more i'd wasted half the week on entrees was it i'd done on the mushrooms which came from the earth or was it mizzonos on the barley maybe it was shahakko the everything else blessing on the soup mushroom barley soup i called out my zoneos rabbi breyer tugged on his beard his eyes narrowing into angry little slits and uh shahako i added rabbi breyer triumphantly smacked his desk signaling that i was correct apple strutal took out david borgen yoel levine and shlomo pomeran's my friend mutti greenberg got stuck with cheesecake and i could tell just by the expression on his face that he had absolutely no idea he wisely offered two answers one for thin crust and one for thick and somehow managed to stay alive it was hard to believe this was only round two a vermi stepped forward i smiled at mutti avermi may have killed his father but he wasn't very bright and he never did well at these things he was lucky to even be in the second round at all bagel shouted rev ibreyer bagel i looked at mutti and disbelief was he kidding bagel bagel called out of remy hamotsi this was bullsh correct shouted rev ibreyer very good the frame green blette of remy epstein and yowell franco all got out on cholent with barley in large pieces of meat while chopped liver on hala with a slice of lettuce and a bit of olive took out four more including mutti and then there were three it was just yuka siel's almanuhu to schneck a remy grunembaum and me round three began houselander shalom called out rabbi breyer i stepped forward ice cream shouted rabbi breyer in a cone ice cream in a cone ice cream in a cone i knew ice cream but why would he add the cone was there something different if it wasn't a cone what was an ice cream cone made of anyway was it cake was it a wafer ice cream in a cone rabbi breyer shouted is the ice cream subordinate to the cone or is it the cone subordinate to the ice cream if it's a sugar cone maybe you really desire the cone ice cream in a cone rabbi breyer shouted again i had no choice ice cream in a cone i called out no blessing everyone in the classroom turned to face me looking back on the whole episode rabbi breyer had really left me no choice no blessing said rabbi breyer why no blessing because i explained nervously twirling my titsus because because the room smells like duty there was a long silence mutted giggled and others followed rabbi breyer slowly rose to his feet his thick fists pushing themselves into the desktop it may have been a loophole but technically speaking i was correct rabbi breyer himself had told us that our sages tell us that the torah tells us that there were three situations in which one is absolutely prohibited from reciting a blessing one while facing a male over the age of nine years old whose genitals are showing two while facing a female over the age of three years old whose genitals are showing and three in the presence of feces frankly given the other two options i think i chose the least offensive answer for a big man rabbi breyer moved pretty quickly it's true i said as he barrelled toward me the torah says that he grabbed me roughly by my arm lifting me clear off the ground and dragged me towards the door shouting angrily in yiddish the whole time but it smells like duty i yelled the room smells like duty wait there's a naked girl in the room there's a naked girl the door slammed shut behind me i stood in the hallway and rubbed my bruised arm i began to cry the blessing bee was lost i was not a great rabbi my father was still not dead i tipped toad toward the classroom door and listened closely two minutes later you could see all zalman yehudasneck fell victim to matsabri with maple syrup and the last man standing was a romy grunembao apple's called out by breyer apple's of romy answered h8's muzzle tuff called out our briar muzzle tuff total bull b the b the b the b the b the b the b the that night we had the traditional friday night gfiltefisch shahakul with a little slice of carrot hadama my father was drunk again singing shabba songs fudging the words and banging heavily on the table with his fist my mother went into the kitchen and brought out the soup when my brother said he didn't want any my father slapped him pushed him over backward onto the floor and poured the hot chicken soup onto his face my mother took my brother into the bathroom and sat with him on the edge of the bathtub pressing a cold washcloth against his cheeks and i went back to the dining room to wipe the chicken soup off the floor chicken soup is a shahakal even if it is cooked with vegetables since chicken is the dominant taste in the soup there by breyer told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that the holy one blessed be he sent the egyptians ten plagues in order to teach us that he gives people many chances to repent and only then if they still continue to sin does he punish them with death i went downstairs to my bedroom took four steps without my amok on touched myself look the lights off and on and fell asleep show my mouse under
