parents here is all the evidence that you need that tv is bad for kids especially public tv when sean was 14 he loved watching those british tv shows they're always running on pbs masterpiece theater dr who and then there was this show that i would stay up really late and watch and tape and watch over and over again the tapes called dempsey and make peace which was about an american detective who went to london because he had been like set up at home and he was teamed up with a woman who was this aristocrat named lady harriet makepeace and i was really on her side she's got it going on you looked down on the american oh yeah what john liked about lady harriet makepeace and all the other brits on tv was their aloofness how they seemed above at all how they looked down on americans which sean did also convinced there must be something wrong with the nation that produced jocks and bullies who harassed him in school and sometimes joking around with his friends he would talk with a british accent and then it was just something that spiraled out of control i know that eventually i was just using an english accent literally from waking to sleeping morning noon and night sean spoke with the british accent from the time he was 14 until he was 16 at some point his mom thought you know maybe i need to do something about this and took him to see a psychiatrist he was just really i don't know the different schools of psychology but he was really very confrontive and he was like well you've got to stop doing this he said because you're not british and my mom just sort of sat over next to me and she sort of went yeah to agree with him and to sort of help him in showing me this sean was furious he had an impulse to lecture the guy on how in fact he was british and the only problem with that was that a he knew very well that he was not and b his mom was sitting right there she was sure to contradict him he didn't know what to do the situation seemed impossible because that's what i was thinking there has to be a way that i can be british still there must be a way that this is true somehow yeah exactly but a day on a radio program stories of people who tell a lie and they get to the point where they believe the lie more than anybody else does it feels like it must be true it happens all the time but i say we are not even going to get into what happens with political figures in this show kidding themselves about the facts of things today we have stories of civilians people like you and me basically pulling hoaxes on ourselves from wbz chicago to this american life i'm ira glass like one of our programs today the sun never sets on the moosewood restaurant in which two young men both from small towns try on new identities false identities and what they have to do to keep the lives going act two conning the con men nancy uptack reports on a federal sting operation and how it caught con men by setting up a con of its own act three edibus hex the little kid tries to get rid of his own father with a very very unlikely plan stay with us act one the son never sets in the moosewood restaurant so this is the story of two young people who for a period in their lives in their search to figure out who they were pretended to be people who they were not we're going to hear from sean cole and from joel lovell we're going to start with sean today's show is a rerun this was quoted years ago these days sean is a producer here at our show sean grew up in a small town in massachusetts a town that was approximately 3350 miles from london it was second nature it was first nature this day i have trouble saying oh i faked an accent for two years i mean i had an accent for two years i like sean could i just ask you to take a deep breath and describe for me what you had for lunch today or perhaps for breakfast this morning in as close to the accent that you can as close as i can yeah okay i'm going to take a sip of water here well ira i had a salad i had it at the boston house of pancakes or a pizza rather what was the beverage it was a snapple a just lemon flavoured i don't really like the peach joe lovell's story began when he left the working class town where he grew up in upstate new york his parents owned a liquor store in a small town he was the first member of his family to go to college and it was an especially big deal because he got into an ivy league school cornell it was one of those first days of college and he spent a lot of time everybody kind of moves and hoards and he spent a lot of time in each other's dorm rooms and there was about oh i don't know 10 or 11 of us in this one guy's room and we were just sitting around eating pizza and talking and people were talking about where they were from and what their parents did and stuff like that and there was one guy whose dad was a doctor for the knicks there was another guy whose father was an elected representative from new york state and then this other guy whose father was on the world court literally was a member of the world court oh my and so it suddenly seemed like this incredibly sort of impressive group to me and they seemed like just sort of worldly in ways that you know they was just beyond my wildest imagination and you know worldly beyond you know what i am now frankly and i remember sort of sitting there at the time thinking oh my god i'm so out of my league here and then completely unplanned i suddenly said you know as a slice of pizza was passed to me this sort of pizza with sausage on top of it i said you know i can't take that because my parents are vegetarians and everybody in the room kind of sort of turned and looked at me because there wasn't even a as if i said well you know i'm a vegetarian but i said you know my parents are vegetarians and there's a sort of puzzled look on everybody in the play in the room and i said well you know and i am too i've never eaten meat and i'm not entirely well i mean i have some ideas now about why i said that but at the time i had no idea what i was saying it was like you know suddenly i'd become possessed and i had to think of something to say about myself that seemed interesting and in vegetarianism was the thing that i chose now did you tell people that you were actually from england no no never that i was from britain but in a way that i was british you know there was a real distinction there for me like i you know i'd taken it on like i was culturally british now well i think what it was is i mean i think i did some sort of calculus that took like a nanosecond in my head and i thought you know i can't actually lie about what my parents do but i think the connections that i was making were this it's somehow like because i was from this town and the sticks if my folks were vegetarians then the whole history that that suggested was that they were sort of these kind of leftist academic radicals who had sort of dropped out of society and gone back to the land and i was living in this bumpkin town in upstate new york and you know my folks were living some sort of life that was driven by their political political philosophy rather than you know i was just a guy who grew up in upstate new york you know i did the old kid thing of like wishing that my real british parents would come and tell me i was adopted and take me back to london so i'm sitting there in the room and all these guys are looking at me and they're like dude you know what do you eat and suddenly i realized i realized in that moment how little i knew about vegetarianism and i kind of tried to be a real sort of vague about it you know we eat salads and lentils i remember sort of saying lentils a lot you know and there was a gap certainly in my education because like i would be using you know words that americans just don't use you know i would instead of saying drugstore i would say chemist or you know i would try my best to remember to say you know bonnet instead of hood or boot instead of trunk but i often couldn't on the meal plan i ended up eating a lot of big piles of iceberg lettuce and chickpeas and during that time would you find yourself sneaking to go to get meat somewhere yeah definitely at first i would go really far from campus in order to have like a blt there was this diner downtown in ithaca and it was you know it felt incredibly illicit i'd be sitting there and i'd have some reading material or something with me and i'd be the lonely guy in my booth and i would order the blt and i would sort of watch it kind of coming from across the room you know with its toothpick in the top of it and a side of french fries with this meat gravy on top and it would just you know when it landed on the table it would just seem like this incredibly you know sort of wonderful moment you know when you're doing something just totally unlike what anybody would expect of you i was nobody you know i mean i was living in an extremely small kind of rural town in the middle of nowhere it was i guess in a way like this was my way of traveling you know in a way of being somebody and sort of achieving an identity which i guess i didn't feel like i had like i didn't feel like i am just sort of realizing this now but i guess i didn't feel as though i had anything that made me up i mean what i realized fairly quickly is that if this is going to be believable i actually have to well i have to believe in it but i also began to not only believe but really sort of take on as my persona all of the stuff that i imagine was associated with vegetarianism so like what certainly certain political convictions and ways of dress i wore ripped jeans and i wore combat boots but i also wore like a kind of stage jacket that you would see in a community theater production of hamlet yeah i bought sandals i very specifically remember going down to this thrift store in downtown ithaca and buying a pair of fatigue shorts which just seemed like i might as well have been shea guevara at that point i mean as far as i was concerned i was a dangerous leftist did you at any point during this find yourself in the following argument where you would say i've never had a hamburger and somebody would insist oh you must have had me at at some point and then you had to argue your side yeah definitely it wasn't pretty and of course i had grown up i mean just to put this in context for a second if you don't mind i mean not only had i had hundreds of hamburgers and gone to the mcdonald's drivethrough hundreds of times but the counterpoint situation that i always think about when i remember this time is that when i was a senior in high school my family for sort of timesaving reasons decided that a great thing to do would be to go to arby's roast beef i don't know if you have those on i think they're country wide so my dad and i would go to arby's on say like a thursday afternoon or something or after i got out of school and we would go in there and we would buy 48 arby's roast beef sandwiches and they would put them in this cardboard box and we would bring home we would bring home this giant box full of those tinfoil covered arby's roast beef sandwiches and we would stuff them in our freezer we would freeze the arby's roast beef sandwiches and then we would have them there buns and all buns and all yeah and so we would have them there as readymade snacks whenever we might want one i mean that's the kind of mediating that my family was engaged the other thing was that i had these runins with with doubting my british identity like oh really yeah as though it were slipping away and i would i would really go nuts at that point and you know there was one time you know there was one time it happened at home i was like at home and i was like oh my god i just you know i have to do something i have to affirm my devotion you know so i think i know i opened up the window and i psyched myself to do it i was like oh man if i don't do this it won't come back and i opened up the window and then i screamed this is the middle of the night or 10 at night i screamed i love england outside the and of course in a british accent outside the window and then you felt better you felt like you had reassured yourself i felt like i had done something at least for england yeah i had fortified my britishness i would find myself in these conversations where people were saying you know you've never had a mcdonald's hamburger what kind of american 18yearold american has never had a hamburger for mcdonald's quite a legitimate question i would add absolutely absolutely and i would say yeah you know i've just never had one they scare me and i would sort of like talk about the ways you know and i would make i think i've picked up these stories about how i'd come close a couple of times how my friend a friend of mine in high school had bought me a big mac and there i was sitting on the front seat of his car i almost ate it and couldn't bring myself to do it so yeah there was all this sort of drama that i lied about my mom and dad came down to visit for parents weekend and they were really proud that i was going there and really excited to come down and they came down to visit and really proud because you were the first generation to go to college you made it into this ivy league school it was a big big deal right exactly exactly and so they drove down from camillus which is about an hour and between an hour and an hour and a half they came down and in that week leading up to parents weekend everybody's talking about their parents coming and everybody's making reservations at restaurants you know where to eat on saturday night and everybody's sort of planning on taking their parents to the football game on you know saturday during the day and it suddenly occurred to me this real sort of panic set in that you know that my parents would come down and we would go to a football game and my dad would buy a hot dog and you know when somebody across the field would see mr lovell eating a hot dog you know and then of course the cat would be out of the bag and so i thought you know i've got to make a reservation at a restaurant at some place either a where nobody else's parents will be or at a vegetarian restaurant and so what i did was make a reservation at the moosewood restaurant which is in ithaca you know there's the moosewood cookbooks that are out and vegetarian cookbooks exactly yeah and it's this nice little vegetarian restaurant in yethika and a slightly famous place but then we got there and you know i remember sitting down at the table in the moosewood and and you know the bowls are these kind of carved wooden bowls and i mean everything about it feels like well like a vegetarian restaurant and not just a vegetarian restaurant but kind of a cartoon of a vegetarian restaurant exactly exactly and i was looking at my parents across the table and they were sort of dressed up and they were excited to be coming down and i could tell like my dad was sitting there and sort of perusing the menu and thinking well maybe this lentil salad will be good or whatever and i could tell he was sitting there thinking jeez i just drove an hour and a half all i want is a steak and a baked potato and a beer you know and there i was bringing them here and but they were so game about it they were so sort of willing to go along with it because for some reason they thought i really wanted to bring them there and i just thought geez you know these parents these people my parents you know have really like given up a lot for me to come there and financially they were really stretching themselves and we were taking out all sorts of loans you know all those things that people do in order to go to college and they never complained once about doing it and they just wanted to come down and see me there and feel proud that i was there and i was sort of hiding them out in this vegetarian restaurant i felt so bad about it afterwards and they never once complained they went home and i imagine i sort of imagine them stopping at a hearty just outside of ithaca and getting up for a hair as soon as they say goodbye but after that i just thought geez i've got to find some way to come clean about this i mean is it okay if your child decides to express himself in an alternate personality for a period of two years i think there's that's funny i never thought i would say this but i think there's nothing wrong with that i never thought i would say it because i think because i wish that i hadn't done it now but maybe i learned something from doing it i mean i think that that is par for the course that's part of now i think that's part of growing up i think it was it was probably necessary for me at that time in my life it gave you more confidence yeah and there was some bridge that this allowed me to cross joe lovell and sean cole joe lovell is the executive editor of a podcast company called pineapple street media sean cole works in public radio indeed he does he's one of the producers of our program that piece of meat on your plate buying water's mode of eating is right think about your act makes me feel under the weather bet you wouldn't care if it came out in feathers bet you wouldn't care if it came out in feathers i'm not a bad guy you're such a psycho i too conning the con men the american legal system for the most part does not uphold the principle of eye for an eye if you steal somebody's car the judge does not steal your car in return if they catch you selling weed they do not sell weed to you as your punishment but if you're in the business of running scams authorities catch you by running a scam on you this is the story of a con man who made millions by fooling people over the phone until he was the one who got fooled nancy eptek reports the guy's name is david diamond that's his actual name he was one of the most successful salesmen in one of the longest running telemarketing scams in los angeles history david diamond was a salesman at a boiler room this is dale skovic he's been a federal trade commission investigator for 29 years he's the one who busted diamond he was living in a very expensive home up in the hills in woodland hills he drove a custom porsche carrera that he had shipped over here by airplane from germany from the factory they lived very high on the hog david diamond was just one of a whole bunch of guys making money hand over fist in an operation in southern california that was basically running the same scam over and over under different names for seven years it was an investment scheme give us your money and we'll put it into this great 900 number business or this online shopping network or this hot new internet service provider needless to say no one ever made a dime except the people running the scam who cleared 40 million since diamond was one of the operations top salesman he made 2 million in commissions in just four years on the job he got 30 of whatever he talked a person into investing that means he personally conned people out of more than 6 million the ftc caught diamond and the others in the operation essentially by conning the con men they had volunteers pose as dupes and record their phone calls because the ftc brought a case against the operation diamond worked in some of those recordings are now part of the public record i got dale sikovic to listen to the tapes with me and talk about david diamond and the fbi volunteer who caught him the woman on the tape i can't tell you her real name but she uses the alias of marge she assumed the identity of a person who is named marge marge was a real person who we in law enforcement and who people in the telemarketing business refer to as a mooch a mooch is someone who will essentially buy anything from anybody who calls her on the telephone in fact she did over a number of years she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars the real march the real march spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on bogus prize promotions investments gold coins you name it so the fbi went to marge and said we really think that we need to take your telephone number away from you because it's being used to ruin your life so once marge agreed to that her telephone number was installed in the home of an fbi volunteer that volunteer every time that phone line rang the marge line that volunteer would pick up that telephone and answer it and pose as march march david diamond how are you okay i'm warm here yeah i sent you off a video and a package yes i have it okay the video is with regard to mark erickson uhhuh mark erickson is is the person who is heading up the program yes and he is very successful in taking up start companies and making them successful you've probably heard of hard copy you're the original producer of hard copy i've heard of it yes okay you're smiling as you listen to this what are you smiling about well i'm smiling because it's been a while since i've heard marge and she sounds so old and so fragile and such an easy mark when in fact you know she's this sharp fbi informant and she doesn't look as old as she sounds trust me so that's one aspect of it the other aspect is this whole mark erickson thing yeah is he a real person mark erickson is a real person he was named in our lawsuit and was he an original producer of hard copy no he was a segment producer and on the air reporter for hard copy for a brief period of time and i mean is this sort of typical of the cons in the tapes that you've heard that they'll try to associate what they're selling with a legitimate business or organization or television show something that people have heard of exactly they want to make this something people can relate to here's the thing you have to invest everything you've got or do nothing at all and i'll say that again you should invest everything you have you should transfer all of your investments into this program or do nothing it doesn't make sense to do just a little bit you should think about doing a million dollars in this program i don't know that's all i'm asking you need to liquidate every nickel you've got you either want to be in this situation you either want to be in this situation whole hardly and upgrade your investments or you don't my suggestion is to do the whole thing well i would never liquidate everything i have my question is why not because there's always gambles in anything like this anything like what well any investment like this well anything you invest in there's always a gamble now i want to ask you you told me once that you thought he sounded nervous on this tape and in this part where she's saying you know an investment like this and he's sort of you know questioning her well what do you mean like this i wonder is do you have any sense that he's suspicious that she might know what he's up to know that volunteers are out there trying to trap them posing as dupes no since we talked about this tape last actually sort of had a revelation that came to me as to why i listened to over 40 individual tapes of david diamond conversations with marge and conversations with others over the course of about a year and one of the things when you've listened to all of them you find that david in sort of the earlier part of that year was much more kind of sweet and cautious and trying to bond with these women and patient and sometimes would spend an hour on the phone with them the tape would be an hour long but this tape was made towards the very end of that year period probably within a week or two of our raid having gone in on the raid and searched david diamond's desk that day i came to realize that david diamond was starting to question whether he wanted to do this anymore he was starting to really have some concerns about what they were doing i believe that in these last couple of weeks that it's kind of shown in this tape he was becoming a little bit desperate he wanted to make a couple of more big hits and he just couldn't figure out why this woman wasn't going to write him a check so he started getting frustrated and it comes out in his voice what evidence did you see that he was starting to have moral qualms about what he was doing david had become born again there were religious tracks all over his office and posters on his wall just recently i don't know exactly what the timeframe was we do know that he had given a lot of the money that he had made to his church we believe that a lot of that was sort of a selfimposed penance that he could justify what he was doing because he was giving was tithing this money that he was taking from these poor victims into his church if 30000 is what you made on every 5000 and you put 50000 in this program that's a 300000 return that's why i'm telling you you need to do a million dollars in this program i don't know i would never put that much in any program do you have an obligation to yourself as an investor to make the most amount of money possible well you know at my age it's really not that uh where i want to say i haven't enough to live on for the rest of my life i understand plus is it still in your best interest to make the most amount of money possible if you can find a way to do it as safely as possible um it's my obligation not to lose what i have but it's also your obligation to keep your money working for a lot of others with the point when i heard this part of the tape even though i knew that this woman this particular woman was not getting conned that she was in fact conning him and trapping him i started to get so angry because i was thinking you know he is really trying to take all of this old woman's money all of it she's saying i have enough to live on he's saying you have an obligation to make more do you ever hear things like that and just get angry even though you know that she's sort of in on the con on the joke every time i hear these pitches i'm outraged because i am the person that spoke to people who really did send david diamond tens of thousands of dollars that consisted of their life savings and now don't have any money to even buy groceries i've interviewed them i've seen them sob yeah it makes me very angry and what sort of recourse do they have slim and none slimmin' none well how much are you investing in this i'm not investing anything in this my investment comes in the time i put with my client yes right and the fact that when they make money they reinvest with me right that's the whole point you're smiling again when she said you know how much are you investing i mean is she just screwing around with him of course she's playing with him yeah i mean she's trained to ask him those kinds of questions so that he responds with a misrepresentation but that doesn't sound like it's part of the script that just sounds like her being mean and sort of a delicious way well no i think what we were trying to do her handler was trying to do was get her get him to say oh yeah i'm in it and i've got my mother and my grandmother in it and i'm putting away money for my child's education with it because then we could show later that he hadn't did you ever talk to marge about what it's like to do this do they ever sort of have fun just thinking i'm just turning the tables on this guy he has no idea i wish i could answer the question i've never spoken to them i'd love to get the answer to that myself i'd like to ask that question myself i think they get a lot of personal satisfaction though how often do you get a chance to catch a bad guy as just a regular civilian yeah exactly you know i do it too i take people using an alias in cases that i work and is it fun i love it i love to get these people to tell me stuff it's you know it's like acting there's a rush the rush of a con the pleasure of it is knowing that you have more power than the person you're conning you know more you know that it's a con and let's face it given the choice between being the mark and being the con man nobody's going to choose to be the mark but the problem is the more confidence you have in your own con the more easily you become a mark yourself con men get taken by other con men all the time there just seems to be something about the particular arrogance of always being on the knowing side of the con that makes for a really really good mark nancy uptake is one of the producers of our program in the years since we first broadcast this episode today's show is a rerun dale skovic the ftc investigator who busted david diamond has died coming up a child tries to fix his own family by harnessing the most powerful force that exists anywhere that's in a minute from chicago bubble radio when our program continues it's just american life american glass each week in our program of course we choose a theme bring you a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme today's show hoaxing yourself stories of people who are fooling themselves sometimes that is a side effect of trying to fool others sometimes they just don't know better and pin their hopes and beliefs on something that is simply not true at all we've arrived at like three of our show act 3 oedipus hex shalom auslander tells this story which happened to him when he was a boy on one of those ultra orthodox jewish religious schools called yeshivas i wanted to listen to this story it's about a little boy in the story the dad is not so nice to his kids which might not be a thing that little kids will enjoy hearing at all so take that under advisement here's shalom rabbi breyer walked into our third grade classroom hung up his long black coat took off his big black hat and handed each student a small black booklet entitled the guide to blessings we had one week he told us to prepare for the annual yeshiva of spring valley blessing bee my heart leapt this was just what my mother needed the blessing bee would make her forget all the troubles of our home to have a son who's a tal malkhacham a y student that was the ultimate her brother was a respected rabbi and if her husband couldn't be one well maybe her son could be the guide to blessings was a 70 page long listing of hundreds of different foods soups breads fish desserts i flipped through it slowly realizing the size of the challenge that lay ahead falafel herring eggplant parmesan i had my work cut out for me friday afternoons the ashiva closed early so that we could all rush home to help our parents prepare for shabbos the sabbath rabbi breyer told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that the preparation for shabbos is equal to the importance of shabbos itself most of my preparations involved searching the house for kosher wine and pouring it down the toilet it was a thankless job i admitted to nobody my father's frustrated rage at not having his maneshevots concord grape was fearsome it was far better than his drunken rage if he did have it i'd search the pantry i'd search the garage i'd search my father's closet but i was only eight years old and there was always a bottle of kedem hiding somewhere i just hadn't thought to check that night my father drunk on a bottle of blushcheblee that got away grabbed my older brother by his shirt collar and dragged him away from the shabbos table he dragged him all the way down the stairs to our bedroom in the basement and slammed the door shut even the silverware jumped who wants the latts matzo ball my mother asked i made extra when my brother returned to the table his nose was bleeding my mother brought him a can of frozen orange juice to hold against the back of his neck which was supposed to somehow stop the bleeding rabbi breyer taught us that it is prohibited to defrost orange juice on chabas because changing food from solid to liquid is considered cooking and cooking is considered working and even god refrained from working on chabas there are 39 different categories of work that are prohibited on chabas that's also why you're not allowed to switch on lights on chabas the electricity causes the filament to glow which is considered burning which is considered working category number two my father came back to the table and drunkenly sang a few chabas songs fudging the words and banging heavily on the table with his fist i sat hunched over absentmindedly drawing circles on the condensation that had formed on the silver water pitcher my father slapped my hand shabbos he shouted writing category number five eventually he stumbled off to his bedroom and fell asleep snoring loudly we sat in the dining room and picked glumly at our food the following monday morning as we all sat studying from our blessing books there was a knock on rabbi breyer's classroom door and rabbi greenbaum the yeshiva principal solemnly entered we all rose the two rabbis conferred quietly for a moment before signaling us all to be seated after a few thoughtful strokes of his long black beard rabbi greenbaum sighed deeply and informed us that the night before our classmate of rummy grunenbaum's father had suffered a heart attack and died some kids have all the luck 'blessed is the one true judge' said rabbi breyer nodding his head 'blessed is the one true judge' we all answered nodding our heads i wondered what mr grunenbaum might have done to deserve death did he bow down to idols did he walk four steps without his yamaka on it was it must have been pretty bad as our bygreenbaum turned to leave he paused and with a stern shake of his finger reminded us all that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that until the age of thirteen all of a boy's sins are ascribed to his father i turned to look at avrami's empty chair avrami was a chubby kid with heavy orthodontia and foul breath but a sudden respect for him grew inside me i wondered what he might have done to cause his father's death whatever it was it must have been pretty bad scowling fiercely rabbi greenbaum advised each and every one of us to pray to hashem the holy one blessed be he for forgiveness so that he wouldn't kill our fathers too my heart leapt blessed is hashem he said blessed is hashem we answered blessed is hashem was right all of a sudden i had two ways i could save my family i could win the blessing beef for my mother or i could sin so much hashem would have to kill my father courageous avrami grunenbaum maybe one shabbos night he had switched on a light maybe he drank milk after eating meat maybe he touched himself that night just before bed i ate a drumstick washed it down with some milk touched myself and flicked the bedroom light on and off break those lights and i'll break your hands my father shouted it was going to be a busy week the blessing bee worked the same way as a spelling bee there are six basic blessings on food hamotsi the blessing for bread mizzonos the blessing for wheat hagefen the blessing for wine or grape juice ha'aits the blessing for things that grow from trees ha'adama the blessing for things that grow from the earth and shahakol the blessing for everything else begel ha'mochi oatmeal mizonos gefiltafish shahakol the blessing for everything else but that was the easy part things became much more complicated when you started combining foods some foods are superior to other foods and in combination with subordinate foods the superior food gets the blessing to make matters worse some blessings are superior to other blessings and you had to know which blessing to recite first this is where they separated the men from the guys spaghetti and meatballs mizonos the wheat blessing then shahakal the everything else blessing cereal with milk shahakal for the milk then mizonos for the wheat and the cereal twix the chocolate candy with the cookie crunch trick question twix isn't kosher i spent the next week sinning and blessing and blessing and sinning alternately praising god and then defying him as much as one eightyearold possibly could monday morning i stuffed myself i had a bowl of fruity pebbles mizonos a slice of toast hamotsi a glass of juice a hot coal half an apple a aids and a couple of old french fries i found at the bottom of the fridge hadamma one meal five blessings tuesday i touched myself i also partook of bread without first ceremoniously washing my hands and that evening before going to sleep i sat on the edge of my bed and carefully recited and a dozen times each my father banged angrily on my bedroom door it's out he barked i smiled for you and me both pal wednesday i stole 5 for my mother and didn't recite any blessings at all on the bag full of candy that i bought with it a charleston shoe which is traff to begin with and a chunky which would have been a shahakol if i weren't trying to kill my father a chunky with raisins shahakol then ha'its thursday i didn't wear tzitzis rabbi breyer noticed that the strings weren't dangling from my sides and grabbed me by the ear and pulled me to the front of the class speak to the children of israel he quoted loudly from the torah as he spanked me hard on my bottom and tell them to make tzitzis on the corners of their garments that afternoon after not respecting my elders by taking out the garbage like my mother had told me to i touched myself and silently begged god to just this once credit those sins to rabbi breyer's account later i defiled a prayer book by carrying it into the bathroom the blessing bee was the following morning and i could barely sleep lentil soup mizonos potato knish hadamak root beer is it a root is it a beer ass bitch i tossed and turned i blessed and cursed and finally i fell into an uncomfortable sleep after a week at home avrami grunenbaum conveniently returned to school just in time for the blessing be it was all i could do to not lean over and ask him how he did it psst avrami tell me was it lobster did you eat lobster rabbi breyer told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that when abraham died hashem comforted isaac we learn from this that it is a tremendous mitzvah or good deed to comfort the bereaved rabbi breyer instructed us all to line up at a vermi's desk to shake his hand and recite the traditional mourners' consolation may hashem comfort you among the mourners of zion being just eight years old i wasn't entirely familiar with hashem's system but it occurred to me that along with all my sins my father might also be getting all my mitzvahs i wasn't taking any chances soon it was my turn in line how's it going i said to avrami rabbi breyer pinched me how i screamed shmendrik he grumbled after the last boy had asked hashem to comfort avrami among the mourners of zion rabbi breyer smacked his desk loudly the blessing bee began we lined up at the back of the classroom nervously pulling on our tzitzis and twirling our peyas the rules were simple name the correct blessing and remain standing for the next round name the wrong blessing and you take your seat last year's winner yuka seel's almunyahudishshnek stood beside me he leaned calmly against the wall mindlessly picking his nose auslander shalom called out rabbi breyer i stepped forward apple he shouted apple i called out ha'ets the blessing for food from trees correct rabbi breyer said the blessing be usually started off pretty easy david borgin got tuna shahako the everything else blessing auri mishinsky got matzah hamochi the blessing for bread and abbey tuckman got stuck with kughal which he thought was hadamma food from the earth but was really mizonos the blessing on wheat three other kids got taken out by oatmeal borshed with sour cream claimed two others and by the end of the first round almost a third of the students were already back in their seats round two auslander shalom called rabbi breyer i stepped forward mushroom barley soup he shouted mushroom barley soup mushroom barley soup damn i knew i should have studied the chapter on soups more i'd wasted half the week on entrees was it a demo on the mushrooms which came from the earth or was it mizzonos on the barley maybe it was shahakol the everything else blessing on the soup mushroom barley soup i called out mizzonos rabbi breyer tugged on his beard his eyes narrowing into angry little slits and uh shahakol i added whereby breyer triumphantly smacked his desk signaling that i was correct apple strudel took out david borghen yoel levine and shlomo pomerance my friend matty greenberg got stuck with cheesecake and i could tell just by the expression on his face that he had absolutely no idea he wisely offered two answers one for thin crust and one for thick and somehow managed to stay alive it was hard to believe this was only round two avermi stepped forward i smiled at mutti avermi may have killed his father but he wasn't very bright and he never did well at these things he was lucky to even be in the second round at all bagel shouted rabbi breyer bagel i looked at mutti in disbelief was he kidding bagel bagel called out avrami hamotsi this was bullc correct shouted rabbi breyer very good frayam greenblatt avrami epstein and yohuel frankel all got out on chulent with barley in large pieces of meat while chopped liver on challah with a slice of lettuce and a bit of olive took out four more including mutti and then there were three it was just yukasieelzalmanyuhudishnek avramigruunenbaum and me round 3 began auslander shalom called out rabbi breyer i stepped forward ice cream shouted rabbi breyer in a cone ice cream in a cone ice cream in a cone i knew ice cream but why would he add the cone was there something different if it was in a cone what was an ice cream cone made of anyway was it cake was it a wafer ice cream in a cone rabbi breyer shouted is the ice cream subordinate to the cone or is it the cone subordinate to the ice cream if it's a sugar cone maybe you really desire the cone ice cream in a cone rabbi breyer shouted again i had no choice ice cream in a cone i called out no blessing everyone in the classroom turned to face me looking back on the whole episode rabbi breyer had really left me no choice no blessing said rabbi breyer why no blessing because i explained nervously twirling my tzitzis because because the room smells like duty there was a long silence mati giggled and others followed rabbi breyer slowly rose to his feet his thick fists pushing themselves into the desktop it may have been a loophole but technically speaking i was correct whereby briar himself had told us that our sages tell us that the torah tells us that there were three situations in which one is absolutely prohibited from reciting a blessing one while facing a male over the age of nine years old whose genitals are showing two while facing a female over the age of three years old whose genitals are showing and three in the presence of feces frankly given the other two options i think i chose the least offensive answer for a big man rabbi breyer moved pretty quickly it's true i said as he barreled toward me the torah says that he grabbed me roughly by my arm lifting me clear off the ground and dragged me towards the door shouting angrily in yiddish the whole time but it smells like duty i yelled the room smells like duty wait there's a naked girl in the room there's a naked girl the door slammed shut behind me i stood in the hallway and rubbed my bruised arm i began to cry the blessing be was lost i was not a great rabbi and my father was still not dead i tiptoed toward the classroom door and listened closely two minutes later you could see all zalman yehuda shnek fell victim to matzah bry with maple syrup and the last man standing was a rumy grunenbaum apples called out rabbi breyer apples a rummy answered haaitz mazel tov called out rabbi breyer mazel tov total bull that night we had the traditional friday night gefilte fish shahakol with a little slice of carrot hadamah my father was drunk again singing shaba songs fudging the words and banging heavily on the table with his fist my mother went into the kitchen and brought out the soup when my brother said he didn't want any my father slapped him pushed him over backward onto the floor and poured the hot chicken soup onto his face my mother took my brother into the bathroom and sat with him on the edge of the bathtub pressing a cold washcloth against his cheeks and i went back to the dining room to wipe the chicken soup off the floor chicken soup is a shahakal even if it is cooked with vegetables since chicken is the dominant taste in the soup thereby breyer told us that the sages tell us that the torah tells us that the holy one blessed be he sent the egyptians ten plagues in order to teach us that he gives people many chances to repent and only then if they still continue to sin does he punish them with death i went downstairs to my bedroom took four steps without my yamak on touched myself looked the lights off and on and fell asleep shulma mauslinder he's the author of many fine books this story appears in
