weird and wonderful things about the world at the same time as improving your english i'm alastair budge and today we are going to be talking about the death of princess diana it is the story of a princess the press the royal family and what people called the utterly preventable death of a young woman <span class="replace">okay</span> then let's get started and talk about the death of princess diana in the early hours of sunday august 31st 1997 a black <span class="replace">mercedes benz</span> entered the <span class="replace">pondelenma</span> underpass a tunnel under the seine river in paris the car was going fast with later reports estimating it was travelling at <span class="replace">105kmh</span> more than double the tunnel's <span class="replace">50kmh</span> speed limit there was a good reason for this or at least you <span class="replace">could</span> understand why the driver was going so fast the car was being chased by a reported 30 paparazzi photographers on mopeds and in cars cameras were flashing as the photographers weaved around the car poking their cameras at the tinted windows the <span class="replace">shutter's</span> clicking nonstop for inside the car was diana princess of wales the former wife of the heir to the british throne and almost certainly the most <span class="replace">recognizable</span> woman in the world next to her was dodi <span class="replace">fayet</span> the son of the egyptian businessman and owner of the harrods department store <span class="replace">mohammed alfayet</span> nobody knows exactly what diana and dodi were talking about on that trip back but the whole world would know what happened next at exactly 23 minutes past 12 shortly after entering the tunnel the driver lost control of the car the mercedes smashed into another car and then crashed headon into a pillar neither dodi nor diana were wearing a <span class="replace">seatbelt</span> dodi fayed was pronounced dead at the scene along with the driver henri paul diana was still alive as was the only other occupant of the car <span class="replace">dodie's</span> bodyguard a man called trevor <span class="replace">rhysjones</span> she was still conscious and was able to talk to the doctors who were fighting to save her life unfortunately it was an unwinnable fight the impact from the crash had been so great that her heart was pushed out of place and this tore a pulmonary vein causing massive internal bleeding at <span class="replace">four o'clock</span> in the morning after almost three and a half hours of french doctors fighting to save her life diana princess of wales the woman many people had thought would become queen was pronounced dead this much of the story i imagine you will know already but what we will do in this episode is try to go a level deeper and unpack what was happening before the crash the crash itself and its aftermath but first let me give a very brief reminder about the protagonist of our story princess diana or diana spencer as she was before she became a princess was born on july 1st 1961 to an aristocratic british family her family had extensive ties to the royal family diana was a distant cousin of <span class="replace">charles</span> diana's grandmother was friends with <span class="replace">charles's</span> grandmother and diana's family even lived in a large mansion that they rented from queen elizabeth on the surface diana had a very privileged upbringing but emotionally it was not a happy one her mother left her father when she was <span class="replace">seven</span> years old and diana would later say that her childhood was very unhappy her family was <span class="replace">well known</span> in aristocratic british circles but it wasn't until her relationship with prince charles that she truly became a household name across the world at the age of 20 she married prince charles in a ceremony that was watched by over 750 million people it was a spectacle of royal pomp and glamour that made her an icon overnight but while her marriage to prince charles was made out to be a fairytale for the press and the public the reality was quite different behind the scenes the marriage was troubled from the <span class="replace">stars</span> with the most wellknown issue being charles' ongoing affair with his former lover camilla parker bowles who you might know is now his wife diana and charles separated in 1992 and would officially divorce <span class="replace">four</span> years later in 1996 in the interests of balance diana also had her own fair share of affairs but she emerged from the divorce in a much more positive light than charles and she stood on her own two feet she was a public figure in her own right she became deeply involved in humanitarian causes including raising awareness about aids and campaigning against the use of landmines she did things that no royal had previously done she hugged a man suffering from aids which was hugely important in debunking the myth that you could catch hiv through physical contact she walked through a field of live landmines she had a warmth approachability and humanity that no member of the royal family had previously shown and you could reasonably argue has shown since her warmth and charisma made her the socalled <span class="replace">people's princess</span> loved by millions around the world she had this rare ability to connect with people particularly the vulnerable and marginalised and this made her immeasurably popular at home and abroad but this popularity came at a price she was relentlessly pursued by the press in a way that no royal before and after ever has been the tabloids followed her every move and the public's fascination with her personal life her relationships and her charity work was insatiable she was constantly hounded by photographers and the scrutiny was so intense that diana publicly spoke out in a tv interview about quite how difficult it was to live under the media's microscope and how she felt that she lived in a goldfish bowl it was this obsession with photographing her as we'll come on to talk about in a minute that some people said ultimately led to her tragic death so what was happening in the leadup to the crash why was diana in paris that night and what role did the paparazzi play in it all diana and <span class="replace">dodie</span> fayed had only met <span class="replace">six</span> weeks before but it was a whirlwind romance they spent the summer of 1997 together travelling on <span class="replace">dodie's</span> father's yacht in the mediterranean and staying at his family's villa in the south of france although it had only been going on for a few weeks their relationship had captured the attention of the press and speculation was rampant about whether the couple were about to announce an engagement on the evening of august <span class="insert">the</span> 30th they ate at the restaurant of the ritz hotel in paris which was owned by <span class="replace">dodie's</span> father mohammed alfayed after dinner they decided to leave and head back to <span class="replace">dodie's</span> apartment before leaving for london the following morning the problem was as always the hordes of paparazzi waiting eagerly outside the hotel knowing that diana and <span class="replace">dodie</span> would have to leave eventually but <span class="replace">dodie</span> had a plan to throw them off to trick them a decoy car was sent to the front of the ritz while diana and <span class="replace">dodie</span> slipped out through a secret door at the back of the hotel and into the mercedes but the plan didn't work they were spotted the paparazzi were soon on their tail chasing the car through the streets of paris this takes us back to that tunnel to the fateful moment when henri <span class="replace">boil</span> lost control and the car smashed into a pillar in the immediate aftermath of the news there was an almost national sense of bereavement in the uk an estimated <span class="replace">one</span> million people travelled to london to pay their respects to her leaving bouquets of flowers and letters of condolence outside buckingham palace and kensington palace her private residence the news was full of interviews with members of the public in tears people who had never met diana but felt like they had lost a loved one of their own a wife mother or sister and britain isn't known to be a nation of people who are particularly comfortable with their emotions you might know the term <span class="replace">stiff</span> upper <span class="replace">lip</span> which is this idea that it is honourable to avoid showing any emotion even in times of great sadness and despair but something was different there were men women and children in tears at the loss of this woman they had never met commentators would later point to it as a defining moment in british history a time when people in britain became comfortable with displaying their emotions for one family in britain however there was no such emotional awakening the royal family was staying at balmoral castle its large country estate in scotland there were some token public statements put out in the press but the queen and the wider royal family were criticised for what was interpreted as a cold and emotionless reaction especially compared to the outpouring of grief from the general public diana's funeral took place a week after her death on september 6th and was watched by an estimated 25 billion people across the world if you were one of them you might remember that her sons the then 12 and <span class="replace">15 year old</span> harry and william walked behind the funeral procession together with prince charles prince <span class="replace">philip</span> and diana's brother the earl of spencer the inclusion of the boys in the funeral procession was highly contentious and was <span class="replace">criticized</span> by many as showing an utter lack of compassion after all these were two boys who had just lost their mother and they were being forced to grieve in front of a live crowd of millions and billions more watching on tv unsurprisingly prince william would later say that walking behind his mother's coffin was one of the hardest things that he has ever done as you <span class="insert">you</span> may remember the guest list at the funeral service itself was a veritable <span class="replace">who's who</span> of notable figures world leaders past and present kings and queens musicians hollywood actors and directors <span class="replace">they</span> had initially been concerns that the funeral shouldn't have been held in westminster abbey a large cathedral in london partly because there wouldn't have been enough guests to fill it these concerns were clearly unfounded every seat was filled and an estimated <span class="replace">two and a half</span> million people descended on the streets of london to pay their respects in the weeks and months afterwards questions started to be asked about who was to blame and whether her death could have been prevented was it simply a tragic accident or were there other forces at play mohammed alfayed dodi's father pointed the finger directly at the royal family and made the shocking accusation that diana and his son were murdered in a plot orchestrated by the british establishment many pointed the finger at <span class="replace">ory boil</span> the driver as tests later revealed he had been drinking alcohol and he was four times the legal limit in other words he was drunk he crashed and that's the end of it others lay the blame squarely with the paparazzi arguing that their pursuit had forced <span class="replace">ariboil</span> to drive at reckless speeds to avoid them the paparazzi had never given her an inch of privacy and to her last breath had used her as a product to squeeze money out of and in one final display of the transactional nature of the paparazzi's relationship with diana as she lay dying in the wreckage of the car instead of trying to help in some way or giving the paramedics the privacy to try to save her life members of the press jumped onto the roof of the car and continued to take photos of the critically injured woman it was the paparazzi that ultimately bore responsibility so the argument goes <span class="replace">now he</span> might have been drunk but he wouldn't have been driving so fast if the car wasn't being pursued by the paparazzi and this is not just a theory it's not just someone's argument there was a lengthy official inquest into the death which concluded that and i'm quoting directly <span class="replace">diana</span> was unlawfully killed by the grossly negligent driving of the following <span class="replace">vehicles the paparazzi and</span> of the mercedes driver <span class="replace">ori</span> paul in other words if she hadn't been followed by the paparazzi and if <span class="replace">ori</span> paul had been sober she would still be alive today and going one level further up some lay the blame at the feet of the public the people who bought the newspapers and magazines that paid the paparazzi for their photos a single picture of diana could go for Â£500000 more than a million euros in today's money so it's hardly surprising that the paparazzi chased her so relentlessly it is us the public who must bear some of the responsibility for endlessly buying the magazines with paparazzi pictures of diana and for having such an insatiable appetite to consume every last detail and picture of the private life of someone who <span class="replace">is</span> a vulnerable and lonely woman struggling to repair her life after a nasty public divorce now it has been more than 25 years since the events of that fateful evening in paris her sons have grown up married and had children of their own they both reportedly have a visceral hatred and distrust of the press especially the <span class="insert">the</span> british tabloid press and who can blame them the official verdict was that their mother's death was unlawfully caused first by the paparazzi without the paparazzi these two men would still have a mother their children would have a grandmother to wrap things up perhaps the question to leave you with is to ask what has been learned from diana's tragic death it highlighted the dark side of fame and the extreme consequences of a relentless press but did it change anything more than 25 years later her story still serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost behind the headlines <span class="replace">okay</span> then that is it for today's episode on the death of princess diana i hope it's been an interesting one and that you've <span class="replace">learned</span> something new you've been listening to english learning for curious minds by leonardo english i'm alastair budge you stay safe and i'll catch you in
