I was at a party last month, and this song came on.  She take my money.  And, you know, normally.  Well, I'm in need.  My first impulse with this song was to just get my eagle on.  But I really did not understand how the DJ didn't get the memo.  So I just stood there.  On the dance floor, not dancing.  What did you want to happen?  I just wanted to not have to think about him.  Right. You just wanted to enjoy the night.  Yeah, I just wanted to enjoy the night.  This was me just, like, running out of runway  to let this person's ideology fly,  if we can even call it an ideology.  But mostly what I was feeling out there on the dance floor  was just, like, another occasion for me to sit in my blackness  and figure out what that is all about.  It's tough, right?  It's really frustrating and it's difficult  to try to figure out our relationship  to someone we don't even know,  but whose work we've had a relationship to for decades.  So thinking about divesting from that is...  It's painful.  It's not a small thing.  No, it's huge.  And it's so huge that I have to be done.  Now, when I say done, I don't mean I'm going to come after people who play the music in my presence.  I just think that I, Wesley Morris, am done trying to make a kind of intellectual sense of the artist formerly known as Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.  I just, it's, we're in deeply vile territory and I can't make intellectual sense of that.  I'm where you're at. I'm past the point of sadness.  Yes, yes.  I'm into a place of rage, discomfort. And historically speaking, there has been a lot  of grace for Ye, right? Probably more than he actually deserved. And I'm thinking about  choosing to associate with Donald Trump and going to Trump Tower.  You know, there has been mounting misogyny,  mounting sexism that got overlooked, right?  Got a pass because the music was so good.  Now we're reaching a point where all that's compounding.  The list is very long,  includes the White Lives Matter shirt, Paris Fashion Week,  this abhorrent interview he gives most recently on Alex Jones' show.  I'm not going to repeat what he said because it's way too vile.  There's no redemption.  There's no accountability.  Every single time this person is given a chance,  including being allowed back on Twitter.  And they just double down.  You know, you and I have talked about Kanye  many, many, many times over the course of this show.  The last time we tried to untangle this topic together,  we decided together we were not going to give up on Kanye,  that we were invested in him and his project  and his mission and curious about it.  a day has arrived where how we feel is different.  Yeah.  So let's get into it.  Let's talk about it.  And also just notice how the atmosphere in this room has changed.  Yeah.  It's always a party in this studio.  Yeah.  Today it's funereal.  Let's talk about why.  I'm Jay Wortham.  I'm Wesley Morris.  And we're two cultural undertakers at the New York Times.  And this is Still Processing.  Can we go back to 2004?  Take me there.  2004, the college dropout comes out.  Mm-hmm.  And I was really feeling like here was a person  I had kind of been waiting for.  Wow.  This guy was iconoclastic  in his insistence that there are rules  that you don't have to follow  to become a successful Black person.  Wow.  He drops out of college the year I graduate.  And one of the things we get taught as a people  is that one of the things that really helps us succeed  is going to get a college degree.  And there was something about its mocking insistence  that it's the wrong way to go.  Huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  there's a whole sketch.  My dad died, and he left me his degrees.  Where the narrator of this little interlude  is basically talking about a story  where his father collects degrees, essentially.  My mom would always say,  Dad, why don't you work?  But he just kept learning.  You know, he wasn't a good father as a result.  Had all these degrees.  He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.  but I just kind of sat there and was like for a lot of us this is a way out it's getting a college  education it feels important to note that at this exact same moment in time another college dropout  is releasing something that will also disrupt notions of productivity and genius and oh yeah  You know, introduce an entirely new paradigm, which is Mark Zuckerberg, famous college dropout, launches thefacebook.com.  And I just bring that up to say that album for me also challenged the idea that the other means of success was to somehow figure out how to be a really savvy college dropout who created a multimillion dollar app that then skyrockets you to stardom and success.  because that was the pressure for my generation at that time, right?  It was this idea of we are at the forefront of a brand new technological revolution,  and if you can't figure it out, you're going to be left behind.  And Kanye College Dropout just also offered a way to say, unsubscribe.  Maybe I don't want that either.  But the way I received aspects of the College Dropout album was that he was essentially  challenging what I can only describe as like a Black orthodoxy that points to middle class  Black success as looking a particular way. I didn't have a problem with that. That wasn't an  or it didn't feel like an orthodoxy to me. But the way that Kanye West was thinking about it, it was.  What I found so moving about Kanye's alternativeness is that he was still a scholar.  And instead of someone presenting papers or dissertations, what he was doing was he was presenting lineage through music, right, through sampling.  You know, part of Kanye's early success resides entirely in his uncanny and genius-like ability to beat match.  And pull tiny snippets and choruses and parts of songs.  And step on them, screw them, smash them.  So they sound completely different and also extremely familiar.  And some people call that production, but I also call that archive work because what you're doing is pulling from the past to make something new for the future.  It's a way of honoring your musical lineage.  It's a way of honoring your musical ancestors, giving them their flowers in real time.  And a key example of that craftsmanship shines on All Falls Down.  Oh, when it all, yeah, all falls down.  This the real one, baby.  I'm telling you I love it.  Shots and I'm standing up.  Which is pulled from Lauryn Hill's devastatingly iconic, unplugged 2002 MTV Live performance.  And she's really talking about the corrosiveness of fame, the music industry, sexism.  By the way, Kanye actually didn't get permission to use the original sample, but he ends up bringing a Chicago singer in, Selena Johnson, to sing the hooks that he uses.  So it's an interpolation of Lauryn Hill's album.  But that's a way of, again, referencing an artist that at that time a lot of people weren't thinking about.  I'm also thinking of a song like Heard Him Say, which includes this just incredibly delicate and lacy piano work.  That's a sample from a Natalie Cole song.  to love. His work with sampling and production was really, really, really validating to think about  musical artistry and deep archival knowledge as being just as important as anything else you  might study in college. And the music was fun. It was fun to listen to. And what was  really exciting about that was that the art seemed free. The person who made the art seemed free.  the sort of personal freedom to be whoever Kanye West the individual is.  And if that happens to lead to thinking in a way that isn't like other Black people,  most Black people, then so be it.  he was the latest Black American artist  to find a way to express,  in his own way,  what freedom could sound like.  Listening to Kanye at least gave me hope  that someone is thinking about another way.  So to have someone like Kanye come out  very boldly and exuberantly  and to say,  I'm creating my own politic.  It has nothing to do with what  the Huxtables were up to.  Because that's what we're really also talking about here right now,  which is a Black paradigm that had been set up and created by the Huxtables.  And here's someone else saying, I don't know, I think there's another way.  Those are my people down there.  So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with.  This is also the period where he goes on that Hurricane Katrina telethon.  There's now over 25 feet of water where there was once city streets.  And stands next to Mike Myers and says,  George Bush doesn't care about Black people.  He looked terrified when he did it.  And that moment made him a folk hero, essentially.  He was expressing feelings that a lot of Black people in this country  felt about the president at that time.  And after these first three albums,  the next three, 808s and Heartbreak,  and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and yeezus have some of that vulnerability to me like he is  he's risking something here in terms of how big he wants to make his ego how small he wants to  make it i think those are three albums that are that are about a person wrestling with something  else there is during this what i would describe as a vulnerability period this turned into darkness  into grimness.  And the whole time,  one of the thrills of these albums  is that as a listener,  you're kind of like,  your hand is near the panic button,  even as the music is kind of blowing your mind.  It seemed like for Kanye during this time  that as he became more successful,  the initial disruption that he created,  right, and the freedom that that allowed him,  perhaps was starting to trap him, right?  I'm thinking really specifically  about that 2013 Zane Lowe interview  where he's asked about the song on Yeezus titled,  I Am A God.  It's a very fast-paced, aggressive song  that just felt like an exorcism of some kind.  And I honestly didn't really grapple with the lyrics too much.  And then you have him in this interview where he's like,  Everybody says, who does he think he is?  I just told you who I thought I was.  A guy.  And that part of the interview is always excerpted as an example of this turn you're describing where we're seeing an artist who's wrestling with inner demons that aren't yet fully outside of themselves in a way.  Like, it's very internal conflict.  But that interview goes on, and what he says next is so illuminating.  He's like,  Would have been better if I had a song that said, I'm a gangster.  Or if I had a song that said, I'm a pimp.  because society is a lot more comfortable with me describing myself in those terms.  But when I say I'm a god, that's when people have a problem.  But there is this sense of someone who feels like they're not being recognized for how great they are.  And that's a really different approach than early Kanye, which is talking about,  I don't care what you think about me.  I'm going to carve a new path.  I'm going to blaze a new way.  Follow me if you want, whatever.  And this Kanye is saying, you do not recognize me for how great I am.  And there's a marked difference there.  Yeah.  And he goes on tour, the Life of Pablo tour.  It's 2016.  And he's giving these erratic speeches from the stage.  And there's a horrible assault robbery incident involving Kim Kardashian.  And during the tour, he is hospitalized with exhaustion.  And the first thing that he does when he gets out of the hospital is go to Trump Tower.  And it wasn't just that he goes to Trump Tower a month after the election.  He goes blonde, a hair color that basically matches Donald Trump's.  Just friends, just friends, and he's a good man.  And the press is trying to ask Ye questions,  and he doesn't answer.  Ye just stands there.  Hmm.  I just want to take a picture right now.  And that was the beginning of some kind of change.  Like, I mean, it was not the beginning.  That was the culmination, to me, of an evolution  towards something that felt unsavory and potentially dangerous.  All the things you're describing, Wesley,  is actually why I decided to go see  St. Pablo, right?  The tour for The Life of Pablo  because that album was so  confounding to me, right?  You have a song like Ultralight Beam,  which is kind of about redemption.  You've got Kirk Franklin.  Father, this prayer is for everyone  that feels they're not good enough.  The expert on Black redemption  in our community and gospel  singing this song with chants  about new beginnings  and hope and optimism.  When you're on an ultralight beam,  when you're on an ultralight beam,  this is a God dream.  And that song goes right into  Father Stretch My Hands Part One.  Beautiful morning,  yeah, the sun in my morning bed.  And then he starts talking about...  Now if I fuck this model,  and she just bleached her asshole.  Which I don't have world judgment around,  but in the context of the key changes of this song  is really befuddling.  So with all this in mind, me and good faith get a ticket, go to St. Pablo concert.  I think I went by myself.  And I was struck by a few things.  One, the entire concert pretty much was attended by white people.  There was something interesting there.  The stage mechanics of that performance, Kanye was suspended on a platform that was shrouded in light.  So much so that you couldn't see the audience.  I mean, this is always true of a concert, right?  The performer is highlighted.  But usually there are these roving spotlights on the crowd  so you can see everyone else in their state of ecstasy  and you're getting giddy off of their giddiness.  And with Kanye, there really wasn't any interest  in being able to see the audience.  All eyes were on Kanye.  And the platform was careening around the arena.  Yeah, it was cantilevered.  And so the people below it were shrouded in darkness  so you could only just see this teeming mass  of Kanye's acolytes essentially reaching their hands up.  I mean, it looked like a Caravaggio painting or something.  It had very gothic elements to it.  I'd say Bosch.  Hieronymus Bosch.  It just felt really clear that  Kanye's self-rendering  was completely transformed.  And that where he was, we weren't meant to access.  One of the things that you and I have been thinking about together in our work separately  is what does ultimate, absolute freedom for Black people in this country look like?  One of the things it seemed like Ye was trying to show us was maybe it does look like voting  for Republicans if you are a conservative. You should be free enough to do that.  why shouldn't you be able to go on Twitter and with a MAGA hat on?  And I don't see why shouldn't I be able to do this?  Because I'm me.  I'm not representing Black people.  I'm representing me.  Yay.  Okay, but well, I don't think that's freedom.  It's not an expansive idea.  It's not an idea that's actually imagining something new.  And I'm drawing a lot of my thinking from a book that has really been  moving me in my own research for my projects called The Long Emancipation by Renato Walcott,  which is trying to help us distinguish between ideas of emancipation and freedom.  His point is that emancipation served as a way to think about not slavery.  Yes.  But it wasn't freedom, right?  Because the newly emancipated Black people in this country still had a ton.  I mean, we still do, but there was a ton of sociopolitical restrictions and limitations on what kind of jobs you could have, where you could live, policing on your hair, policing on your body.  I mean, we have an approximation of freedom, but because we're still in this post-slavery economy, it's really hard to know what it would actually mean to be free.  And so the book is asking us to think about being in a long period of emancipation rather than ever having approached freedom.  I want that freedom for all of us.  I just have a really hard time believing that a true expression of freedom comes at the expense of other people's safety, other people's humanities, and other people's sense of dignity.  Well, that's the point at which his going to Paris during Paris Fashion Week and wearing the T-shirt that says White Lives Matter comes in, right?  Not just that all lives matter.  That would have been bad enough.  But he wore a shirt that said White Lives Matter.  Talking about, like, I'm going to go death con three, death con three, D-E-A-T-H, con three on Jewish people.  For me, that was the moment where, I mean, all the wheels fall off.  The wheels had been falling off the bus for a minute, though, right?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  It's important to remember that Kanye has been practicing misogynoir for a really long time.  Songs like Gold Digger, right?  Even songs like Flashing Lights.  You know, there's always this narrative that just paints him as a victim to greedy Black women.  and the entire narrative around Amber Rose  in the aftermath of their relationship,  he just painted her as this opportunistic,  greedy little slut.  And he had to take 30 showers  after he broke up with her.  And that was on the radio and everybody laughed.  The culture was just like,  yeah, who cares about her?  I'm probably as guilty as anybody.  We all are.  I mean, we're talking about this cultural complacency  and our role in helping create this social monster that we have today.  So there had already been a lot of corrosive behavior  towards a lot of vulnerable people  before all of this blew up in the last handful of months.  Well, I mean, I think we should take a break.  And when we come back,  we should talk about exactly how blown up things are  because whatever seemed free about this person  is actually the opposite. <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> My name is Audra D.S.

I'm not inside that man's brain.  I'm not inside anybody's head but my own.  What's coming up for me in all of this  is that this is not the first time  we have been here as a people.  Other people have made this choice  to try to challenge  what we initially were calling an orthodoxy, right?  But what it really is,  is our sense of community.  One of the earliest people who comes to mind  is a guy named George Schuyler.  Wrote one of my favorite books.  It's called Black No More.  A book that came out in 1931.  And it's basically about a scientist who creates a way for Black people to become white. And the main character undergoes this procedure, turns from a Black person to a white person, and becomes a bigwig in a white supremacist organization that's kind of like the KKK, marries the daughter of the head Klansman who is trying to stop this race-changing procedure from making things worse for white people.  How does the technology impact your DNA?  Well, funny you should ask, because whenever in this novel a Black person who's turned white reproduces with their new white spouse, they produce a Black baby.  Right, right. That was my question.  The DNA. Don't lie.  And that's the point of the satire, right?  But at some point, everybody's confused about everything in this book, including, I would say, George Schuyler.  Okay.  Who, in the years after its publication, becomes increasingly conservative and increasingly anti-Black.  You know, he releases statements like condemning Martin Luther King as being nothing more than a huckster.  And then let's just fast forward to Clarence Thomas, who begins his intellectual life as a Black nationalist and winds up on the Supreme Court as what, as far as I can see, is its most conservative member.  and he's been on the court longer than anybody at this point.  And essentially, his jurisprudence amounts to casting a vote  against every piece of civil rights legislation that comes to the court.  Racial equity, racial fairness, racial justice.  And the reason to bring George Schuyler and Clarence Thomas  into our conversation about Kanye West Jay  is just how can they express their own beliefs  as individual Americans?  And what happens when those beliefs  don't necessarily correspond  with the majority of Black Americans?  Does that mean that the rest of us are sheep  and that these are the free thinkers?  Or are they what, you know,  classically gets called Uncle Toms?  Because all that alleged free thinking  just winds up doing more harm to people, Black people, Jews, I mean, all people.  We've been talking about this in terms of freedom,  but I wonder if it's a question of their imaginations, right?  The imagination is so limited.  I mean, I've been thinking so much in our conversation about Robin G. Kelly's book,  Freedom Dreams, where he tries to go back and chronicle what Black activists have been doing  to try to imagine their ways out of the constraints that we're in, right? That we're trying to go  someplace we've never been before, and new tools and tactics are required. That true liberation  really does involve the imagination, because we can't see what we don't know yet. And  And I think that's why I keep coming back to this idea of how limited this imagination is.  To talk about violence, whether it's against women you've dated, you know, people you feel you're in competition to, is so unimaginative and boring and completely uninteresting.  In addition to it just being completely unacceptable.  That's what discounts Kanye for me.  the problem is the closer it got to white supremacy the less interesting the art became  as long as you're out there trying to align a white lives matter t-shirt with an artistic practice  your art is run aground your art is run out of anything interesting or new to say right  The turning point for me around Kanye, though, was him lashing out at the Vogue editor.  At around the same time.  Around the same time.  That the White Lives Matter shirts happened.  I was watching it unfold on Instagram stories.  Mm-hmm.  So I was watching along with Vogue contributing editor Gabriella Karifa Johnson, who was at that show in October.  Mm-hmm.  And, you know, she said to promote these ideas and white supremacist ideology on a fashion show and loop in Black people to also promote it, she's saying, is a very scary and dangerous and violent thing.  She was just like, this isn't art.  This isn't good art.  And Kanye immediately singled her out.  He posted a picture of her.  He mocked her clothes.  He mocked her shoes.  I mean, this is someone who has millions and millions of people following him.  And to direct the fire hose of that attention at this Black woman is a very scary and unsettling thing to do.  And immediately, so many people jumped to her defense.  People are posting, talking about her right to express her critique and criticism as a Vogue editor at Fashion Week.  That's literally what they're sent there to do.  and what ends up happening is a meeting between all of them is arranged and then kanye tweets out  like we're good now this is my sister yeah it's just chaos i think what we're i mean i think the  other other thing we're talking about is this other race of people what they're called famous  people oh yeah fame is a race yeah it is i mean if if black white you know those are all constructs  this one is too so is fame and at some point i think famous people really think that their  fame and power and money you're talking about money like money is the thing that undergirds  all this too.  Yes.  And I think all those things  entitle people  to say and do  whatever it is  they want.  Hmm.  Maybe Kanye isn't Black.  Maybe he's just famous  in his mind.  What do you mean by that?  I mean that  the story  that it would seem  that he can tell himself  is that  it's the George Skyler story.  It's the Black No More story.  Mm-hmm.  I have moved over to this other side, and I think it's pretty great.  Look at me.  I just put a bunch of people in White Lives Matter t-shirts and sent them out at a fashion show.  I mean, what Black person would think to do that?  Me.  You and I arrived in strangely different places.  Like the way I'm orienting myself right now is I'm trying to ask of myself different questions as a consumer, as a cultural critic, as a thinker.  Like I am really trying to assess what in me let me overlook those things for so long?  And how can I pay that attention forward?  Who are some of the artists, creators, thinkers, producers right now who deserve some of that energy, right?  I'm thinking about Thames, FNF. I'm thinking of a ton of incredibly talented Black women artists who are coming up right now who are geniuses. And I'm just trying to do my own reparative work and understand how I can do better differently, right? Because I recognize that I'm part of the economy that gave Kanye permission for so long.  Because I'm not going to be able to change Kanye.  I can't ask him to show up differently.  I can't even, you know, the only work I can do is really analyze my own priorities and interests and curiosities.  I think the thing that has brought us together to talk about this is not that it is happening or that it is news.  Hmm. Mm-hmm.  I think the reason that for many of us, the problem presented by this person is personal.  I mean, it's individually personal, right?  Like, the thing about college dropout that so bothered me was that I received it as an indictment, not actually of getting an education.  I received it as an indictment of getting an education with white people.  he doesn't say any of that on the album  but I went to Yale  the numbers just made it so that most of my friends were white  and one of the things that we black people talked about a lot  was what it's going to mean  to then have these relationships  these close friendships with white people  the fear I felt  was that I would get to this school and get this education,  but that it was going to cost me something.  And the price was going to be my Blackness.  Even though I live a life among white people,  there are white people in my life,  there have been white people in my bed,  i've never ever ever felt in danger of losing my sense of who i am as a black american person  but i've always worried yeah and wondered simultaneously why why am i not making the  same choices Kanye West made. He's got stage four cancer of the thing that I am a hypochondriac  about. You know what I'm thinking of right now? You know, in The Walking Dead, when they go to  the CDC, this is like pretty early on. It's probably season one. I bear my soul. You pulled  out The Walking Dead. Okay. But listen, hear me out. Hear me out. I'm with you. Okay. Okay.  But early on in AMC's The Walking Dead, someone gets the idea that we should go to the CDC because that's where all the answers will be.  They make their way there and they realize that the virus that turns people into zombies after they've been killed is in all of them.  That all of them are actually already infected.  There is no the infected.  It only activates after you're dead. And it's a heart-crushing episode because you realize that the cure they'd been looking for doesn't really seem to exist. And everyone at any moment has the potential to become a cannibal, to turn on themselves really first and then everyone else around them.  So I'm listening to you talk and I'm thinking about this way in which this fear that there could be something latent inside of all of us that turns us unrecognizable.  And that also is related to white supremacy.  You know, we all grow up in this world.  You know, it's all in the water.  and what's between you and me and someone like kanye is mental health issues right a lot of money  a lot of enabling and a lot of self-loathing and an economy that's not stopping you but  yeah the worry that somehow we'll lose track of ourselves that's a real fear and it's not  unfounded.  The fear that I have  is that what you so  beautifully  encapsulated  as being a  like a latent  possibility  in all of us.  Mm-hmm.  It's so  depressing  and infuriating  to watch it  proliferate  in somebody else.  I mean,  we haven't even talked about  really the fact that  Kanye West is not well.  And no one knows what to do about that unwellness. And it makes me think about Amy Winehouse. It makes me think about a certain era of Britney Spears' life when someone's spiral that feels like it's approaching a death spiral is just tabloid fodder.  There's an attention economy, which is why people are talking about divesting from Kanye and just stopping paying attention. Stop paying attention.  But what I'm also hearing you say is that the real freedom in this scenario is our freedom to leave him out there.  Yeah. I mean, it's sad. It's really, really sad. And the only power that we have as a society is just to say, like, we do not tolerate this and we don't condone this. And that's where we're at with Kanye.  But I do think that it's not about leaving Kanye. It's about leaving someone who is completely unwilling to be accountable for the harms they're causing. And that the only way to inoculate ourselves‚Äî  I was thinking about an infection.  from it spreading  is to quarantine ourselves.  It hurts.  It does.  That's our show.
