It can be joyous, it can be uncomfortable, but I feel that it is absolutely necessary—not just for understanding who you are, but also understanding the person in front of you. We are trying to wrestle with these really hard subjects, and maybe not always answering the questions, but asking the right ones. And listening—listening a lot. *The Times* is dedicated to ambitious and well-covered reporting on race and identity, and they’re willing to back it up with the necessary resources. If you are curious about the world we live in, I would encourage you to subscribe to The New York Times.\n",
