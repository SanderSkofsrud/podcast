what does beauty have to do with sports or advanced technology or the economy i am isabella rossellini and in each episode of this is not a beauty podcast i uncover stories that explain beauty's fascinating and often hidden role in modern life listen to this is not a beauty podcast now on your favorite podcast platform brought to you by l'or√©al group j what's up i was at a party last month and this song came on she take my money and you know normally well i'm in need my first impulse with this song was to just get my eagle on oh you give me money but i really did not understand how the dj didn't get the memo hmm so i just stood there on the dance floor not dancing what did you want to happen i just wanted to not have to think about him right you just wanted to enjoy the night yeah i just wanted to enjoy the night this was me just like running out of runway to let this person's ideology fly if we can even call it an ideology but mostly what i was feeling out there on the dance floor was just like another occasion occasion for me to sit in my blackness and figure out what that is all about it's tough right it's really frustrating and it's difficult to try to figure out our relationship to someone we don't even know but who we work we've had a relationship to for decades so thinking about divesting from that is it's painful it's not a small thing no it's huge and it's so huge that i have to be done now when i say done i don't mean i'm going to come after people who play the music in my presence i just think that i wesley morris am done trying to make a kind of intellectual sense yeah of the artist formerly known as kanye west who now goes by ye mmhmm i just it's written deeply vile territory and i can't make intellectual sense of that i'm where you're at i'm past the point of sadness yes yes and into a place of rage uhhuh uhhuh discomfort and historically speaking there has been a lot of grace for ye probably more than he actually deserved and i'm thinking about choosing to associate with donald trump and going to trump tower there has been mounting misogyny mounting sexism that got overlooked got to pass because the music was so good now we're reaching a point where all that's compounding the list is very long includes the white lives matter shirt paris fashion week this uphorn interview he gives most recently on alex jones' show i'm not gonna repeat what he said because it's way too vile there's no redemption there's no accountability every single time this person is given a chance including being allowed back on twitter they just double down you know you and i have talked about kanye many many many times over the course of the show the last time we tried to untangle this topic together we decided together we were not gonna give up on kanye that we were invested in him and his project and his mission and curious about it a day has arrived where how we feel is different yeah so let's get into it let's talk about it and also just notice how the atmosphere in this room has changed yeah it's always a party in the studio yeah today it's funerial let's talk about why i'm jay wortham i'm wesley morris and we're two cultural undertakers at the new york times and this is still processing can we go back to 2004 take me there 2004 the college dropout comes out and i was really feeling like here was a person i had kind of been waiting for this guy was iconic plastic in his insistence that there are rules that you don't have to follow to become a successful black person wow he drops out of college the year i graduate and one of the things we get taught as a people is that one of the things that really helps us succeed is going to get a college degree and there was something about its mocking insistence that it's the wrong way to go there's a whole sketch my dad died and he left me his degrees where the narrator of this little interlude is basically talking about a story where his father collects degrees essentially my mom would always say dad why don't you work but he just kept learning you know he wasn't a good father as a result had all these degrees he was so greedy with degrees he took my degree but i just kind of sat there and was like for a lot of us this is a way out it's getting a college education it feels important to note that at this exact same moment in time another college dropout is releasing something that will also disrupt notions of productivity and genius and introduce an entirely new paradigm which is mark zuckerberg famous college dropout launches the facebookcom and i just bring that up to say that album for me also challenged the idea that the other means of success was to somehow figure out how to be a really savvy college dropout who created a multimillion dollar app that then sky rockets you to stardom and success because that was the pressure for my generation at that time right it was this idea of we are at the forefront of a brand new technological revolution and if you can't figure it out you're going to be left behind and kanye college dropout just also offered a way to say unsubscribe maybe i don't want that either but the way i received aspects of the college dropout album was that he was essentially challenging what i can only describe as like a black orthodoxy that points to middle class black success as looking a particular way i didn't have a problem with that that wasn't an it didn't feel like an orthodoxy to me but the way that kanye west was thinking about it it was what i found so moving about kanye's alternativeness is that he was still a scholar and instead of someone presenting papers or dissertations what he was doing was he was presenting lineage through music right through sampling you know part of kanye's early success resides entirely in his uncanny and geniuslike ability to beatmatch and pull tiny snippets and choruses and parts of songs and step on them screw them smash them so they sound completely different and also extremely familiar and some people call that production but i also call that archive work because what you're doing is pulling from the past to make something new for the future it's a way of honoring your musical lineage it's a way of honoring your musical ancestors giving them their flowers in real time and a key example of that craftsmanship shines on all falls down this is the real one baby i'm telling you i love you this is our dance fan which is pulled from lauren hill's devastatingly iconic unplugged 2002 mtv live performance oh when did all old phones die telling you old and she's really talking about about the corrosiveness of fame the music industry sexism by the way kanye actually didn't get permission to use the original sample but he ends up bringing a chicago singer in selena johnson to sing the hooks that he uses so it's an interpolation of lauren hill's album but that's a way of again referencing an artist that at that time a lot of people weren't thinking about mmhmm mmhmm where is the where where is the where i'm also thinking of a song like heard him say which includes this just incredibly delicate and lacy piano work yeah and i heard him say nothing's ever promised him all the day that's a sample from a natalie cole song there's someone in this world that i'll always choose to love his work with sampling and production was really really really validating to think about musical artistry and deep archival knowledge as being just as important as anything else you might study in college and the music was fun it was fun to listen to and what was really exciting about that was that the art seemed free the person who made the art seemed free the sort of personal freedom to be whoever kanye west the individual is and if that happens to lead to thinking in a way that isn't like other black people most black people then so be it he was the latest black american artist to find a way to express in his own way what freedom could sound like to kanye at least gave me hope that someone is thinking about another way so to have someone like kanye come out very boldly and exuberantly and to say i'm creating my own politic it has nothing to do with what the huckstables were up to because that's what we're really also talking about here right now which is a black paradigm that had been set up and created by the huckstables and here's someone else saying i don't know i think there's another way of my people down there so anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with this is also the period where he goes on that hurricane katrina telethon there's now over 25 feet of water where there was once city streets and stands next to mike myers and says george bush doesn't care about black people he looked terrified when he did it and that moment made him a folk hero essentially he was expressing feelings that a lot of black people in this country felt about the president at that time and after these first three albums the next three 808s and heartbreak and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and jesus have some of that vulnerability to me like he is he's risking something here in terms of how big he wants to make his ego how small he wants to make it i think those are three albums that are there are about a person wrestling with something else there is during this what i would describe as a vulnerability period this turn into darkness into grimness and the whole time one of the one of the thrills of these albums is it as a listener you're kind of like your hand is near the panic button even as the music is kind of blowing your mind it seemed like for kanye during this time that as he became more successful the initial disruption that he created right and the freedom that that allowed him perhaps was starting to trap him right i'm thinking really specifically about that 2013 zane lowe interview where he's asked about the song on yeezus titled i am a god it's a very fastpaced aggressive song that just felt like an exorcism of some kind and i honestly didn't really grapple with the lyrics too much and then you have him in this interview where he's like everybody says who does he think he is i just told you who i thought i was a god and that part of the interview is always excerpted as an example of this turn you're describing where we're seeing an artist who's wrestling with inner demons that aren't yet fully outside of themselves in a way like it's very internal conflict but that interview goes on and what he says next is so illuminating he's like would it been better if i had a son is that i'm a gangster or if i had a son to say i'm a pimp because society is a lot more comfortable with me describing myself in those terms but when i say i'm a god that's when people have a problem but there is this sense of someone who feels like they're not being recognized for how great they are and that's a really different approach than early kanye which is talking about i don't care what you think about me i'm gonna carve a new path i'm a blaze a new way follow me if you want whatever and this kanye is saying you do not recognize me for how great i am and there's a marked difference there yeah and he goes on tour the life of pablo tour it's 2016 and he's giving these erratic speeches from the stage and there's a horrible assault robbery incident involving kim kardashian and during the tour he is hospitalized with exhaustion and the first thing that he does when he gets out of the hospital is go to trump tower and it wasn't just that he goes to trump tower a month after the election he goes blonde a hair color that basically matches donald trump's just friends just friends and it's a good man and the press is trying to ask yeh questions and he doesn't answer yeh just stands there mm the president wants to be right but there's nothing to say i just want to take a picture right now and that was the beginning of some kind of change like i mean it was not the beginning that was the culmination to me of an evolution towards something that felt unsavory and potentially dangerous all the things you're describing wesley is actually why i decided to go see st pablo right the tour for the life of pablo because that album was so confounding to me right you have a song like ultra light beam which is kind of about redemption you've got kirk franklin father this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough the expert on black redemption in our community and gospel singing the song with chance about new beginnings and hope and optimism and that song goes right into father stretch my hands part 1 and then he starts talking about which i don't have world judgment around but in the context of the key changes of the song is really befuddling so with all this in mind me and good faith get a ticket go to st pablo concert i think i went by myself and i was struck by a few things one the entire concert pretty much was attended by white people there was something interesting there the stage mechanics of that performance kani was suspended on a platform that was shrouded in light so much so that you couldn't see the audience i mean this is always true of a concert right the performer is highlighted but usually there are these roving spotlights on the crowd so you can see everyone else in their state of ecstasy and you're getting off of their giddiness and with kanye there really wasn't any interest in being able to see the audience all eyes were on kanye and the platform was careening around the arena yeah it was cantilevered and so the people below it were shrouded in darkness so you could only just see this teeming mass of kanye's acolytes essentially reaching their hands up i mean it looked like a caravaggio painting or something it had very gothic elements to it i'd say bosch heronimus bosch ha ha ha oh it just felt really clear that kanye's self rendering was completely transformed mmhmm and that where he was we weren't meant to access one of the things that you and i have been thinking about together in our work separately is what does ultimate absolute freedom for black people in this country look like one of the things that seemed like ea was trying to show us was maybe it does look like for republicans if you are conservative you should be free enough to do that why shouldn't you be able to go on twitter and with a maga hat on and well i don't see why shouldn't i be able to do this because i'm me i'm not representing black people i'm representing me yay okay but well i don't think that's freedom it's not an expansive idea it's not an idea that's actually imagining something new and i'm drawing a lot of my thinking from a book that has really been moving me in my own research for my projects called the long emancipation by renato walcott which is trying to help us distinguish between ideas of emancipation and freedom yeah his point is that emancipation served as a way to think about not slavery but it wasn't freedom right because the newly emancipated black people in this country still had a ton i mean we still do but there was a ton of sociopolitical restrictions and limitations on what kind of jobs you could have where you could live policing on your hair policing on your body i mean we have an approximation of freedom but because we're still in this postslavery economy it's really hard to know what it would actually mean to be free and so the book is asking us to think about being in a long period of emancipation rather than ever having approached freedom i want that freedom for all of us i just have a really hard time believing that a true expression of freedom comes at the expense of other people's safety other people's humanities and other people's sense of dignity well that's the point at which his going to paris during paris fashion week and wearing the tshirt that says white lives matter comes in right not just that all lives matter that would have been bad enough but he were sure this had white lives matter talking about like i'm going to go death con three death con three dea th con three on jewish people for me that was the moment where i mean all the wheels fall off the wheels had been falling off the bus for a minute though right yes yes yes yes it's important to remember that kanye has been practicing miss algenor for a really long time songs like gold digger right even songs like flashing lights there's always this narrative that just paints him as a victim to greedy black women and the entire narrative around amber rose and the aftermath of their relationship he just painted her as this opportunistic greedy little slut and he had to take 30 showers after he broke up with her and that was on the radio and everybody laughed the culture was just like yeah who cares about her i'm probably as guilty as anybody we all are i mean we're talking about this cultural complacency and our role in helping create this social monster that we have today so there had already been a lot of corrosive behavior towards a lot of vulnerable people before all of this blew up in the last handful of months well i mean i think we should take a break and when we come back we should talk about exactly how blown up things are because whatever seemed free about this person is actually the opposite my name is audra d s birch and i am a national correspondent covering race and identity for the new york times race coverage is complicated it can be joyous and affirming it can be uncomfortable but i feel like it's still absolutely necessary race and identity are not just understanding who you are but who the person in front of you is and wanting to understand more about them we're trying to wrestle down these really hard subjects and maybe not answering the question but asking the right questions and listening listening listening a lot the times is dedicated to ambitious and deeply reported coverage of race and identity and they're willing to back it up with resources if you are curious about the world on which we live if you're interested in who you are where you come from and how you relate to others i would encourage you to subscribe to the new york times it's hard to really talk about where i think connie is at and what i think is going on with him because the truth is i don't know i'm not inside that man's brain i'm not inside anybody's head but my own what's coming up for me in all of this is that this is not the first time we have been here as a people other people have made this choice to try to challenge what we initially were calling an orthodoxy right but what it really is is our sense of community one of the earliest people who comes to mind is a guy named george schuyler wrote one of my favorite books it's called black no more that came out in 1931 and it's basically about a scientist who creates a way for black people to become white and the main character undergoes this procedure turns from a black person to a white person and becomes a big wig in a white supremacist organization that's kind of like the kkk marries the daughter of the head clansman who is trying to stop this racechanging procedure from making things worse for white people how does the technology impact your dna well funny you should ask because whenever in this novel a black person who's turned white reproduces with their new white spouse they produce a black baby right right that was my question the dna don't lie and that's the point of the satire right but at some point everybody's confused about everything in this book including i would say george schuyler who in the years after its publication becomes increasingly conservative and increasingly antiblack you know he released his statements like condemning martin luther king as being nothing more than a huckster and then let's just fast forward to clarence thomas who begins his intellectual life as a black nationalist and winds up on the supreme court as what as far as i can see is its most conservative member and he's been on the court longer than anybody at this point and essentially his jurisprudence amounts to casting a vote against every piece of civil rights legislation that comes to the court racial equity racial fairness racial justice and the reason to bring george schuyler and clarence thomas into our conversation about kanye west j is just to how could they express their own beliefs as individual americans and what happens when those beliefs don't necessarily correspond with the majority of black americans does that mean that the rest of us are sheep that these are the free thinkers or are they what you know classically gets called uncle tom's because all that alleged free thinking just winds up doing more harm to people black people jews i mean all people we've been talking about this in terms of freedom but i wonder if it's a question of their imaginations right the imagination is so limited i mean i've been thinking so much in our conversation about robin g kelly's book freedom dreams where he tries to go back and chronicle what black activists have been doing to try to imagine their ways out of the constraints that we're in right that we're trying to go someplace we've never been before and new tools and tactics are required yes yes yes yes true liberation really does involve the imagination because we can't see what we don't know yet and i think that's why i keep coming back to this idea of how limited this imagination is to talk about violence whether it's against women you've dated people you feel you're in competition to is so unimaginative and boring and completely uninteresting interesting in addition to it just being completely unacceptable that's what discounts kanye for me the problem is the closer it got to white supremacy the less interesting the art became as long as you're out there trying to align a white lives matter tshirt with an artistic practice your art is run aground art is run out of anything interesting or new to say right the turning point for me around kanye though was him lashing out at the vogue editor around the same time around the same time that the white lives matter shirts happened i was watching it unfold on instagram stories so i was watching along with vogue contributing editor gabriela carifa johnson who was at that show in october and you know she said to promote these ideas and white supremacist ideology on a fashion show and loop in black people to also promote it she's saying is a very scary and dangerous and violent thing she was just like this isn't art this isn't good art and kanye immediately singled her out he posted a picture of her he mocked her clothes he mocked her shoes i mean this is someone who has millions and millions of people following him and to direct the fire hose of that attention this black woman is a very scary and unsettling thing to do and immediately so many people jump to her defense people are posting talking about her right to express her critique and criticism as a vogue editor at fashion week that's literally what they're sent there to do do and what ends up happening is a meeting between all of them is arranged and then kanye tweets out like we're good now this is my sister yeah it's just chaos i think what we're i mean i think the other other thing we're talking about is this other race of people what they're called famous people oh yeah fame is a race yeah it is i mean if black white you know those are all constructs this one is too so is fame and at some point i think famous people really think that their fame and power entitles them and money you're talking about money like money is the thing that undergrads all this too yes and i think all those things entitle people to say and do whatever it is they want maybe kanye isn't black maybe he's just famous in his mind what do you mean by that i mean that the story that it would seem that he can tell himself is that it's the george schuyler story it's the black no more story i have moved over to this other side and i think it's pretty great mm look at me i just put a bunch of people in white lives matter tshirts and sent them out at a fashion show mm i mean what black person would think to do that me you and i arrived in strangely different places like the way i'm orienting myself right now is i'm trying to ask of myself different questions as a consumer as a cultural critic as a thinker like i am really trying to assess what in me let me overlook those things for so long and how can i pay that attention forward who are some of the artists creators thinkers producers right now who deserve some of that energy right i'm thinking about thames ff i'm thinking of a ton of incredibly talented black women artists who are coming up right now who are geniuses and i'm just trying to do my own reparative work and understand how i can do better differently right because i recognize that i'm part of the economy that gave kanye permission for so long because i'm not gonna be able to change kanye i can't ask him to show up differently i can't even you know the only work i can do is really analyze my own priorities and interests and curiosities i think the thing that has brought us together to talk about this is not that it is happening or that it is new i think the reason that for many of us the problem presented by this person is personal personal i mean it's individually personal right like the thing about college dropout that so bothered me was that i received it as an indictment not actually of getting an education i received it as an indictment of getting an education with white people he doesn't say any of that on the album but i went to yale the numbers just made it so that most of my friends were white and one of the things that we black people talked about a lot was what it's going to mean to then have these relationships these close friendships with white people the fear i felt was that i would get to this school and get this education but that it was going to cost me something and the price was going to be my blackness know i live a life among white people there are white people in my life there have been white people in my bed i've never ever ever felt in danger of losing my sense of who i am as a black american person but i've always worried and wondered simultaneously why why am i not making the same choices kanye west made mmhmm he's got stage 4 cancer of the thing that i am a hypochondriac about you know what i'm thinking of right now you know in the walking dead when they go to the cdc this is like pretty early on it's probably season one i bear my soul you pulled out the walking dead okay but listen hear me out hear me out i'm here hold on okay okay early on in amc is the walking dead someone gets the idea that we should go to the cdc because that's where all the answers will be they make their way there and they realize that the virus that turns people into zombies after they've been killed is in all of them that all of them are actually already infected there is no the infected it only activates after you're dead and it's a heartcrushing episode because you realize that the cure they'd been looking for doesn't really seem to exist and everyone at any moment has the potential to become accountable to turn on themselves really first and then everyone else around them so i'm listening to you talk and i'm thinking about this way in which this fear that there could be something latent inside of all of us that turns us unrecognizable and that also is related to white supremacy you know we all grow up in this world you know it's all in the water and what's between you and me and someone like kanye is mental health issues right a lot of money a lot of enabling and a lot of selfloathing and an economy that's not stopping you but yeah the worry that somehow we'll lose track of ourselves that's a real fear and it's not unfounded the fear that i have is that what you so beautifully encapsulated as being a latent possibility in all of us it's so depressing and infuriating to watch it proliferate in somebody else i mean we haven't even talked about really the fact that kanye west is not well and no one knows what to do about that unwellness and it makes me think about amy winehouse it makes me think about a certain era of britney spears' life when someone's spiral that feels like it's approaching a death spiral is just tabloid fodder there's an attention economy which is why people are talking about divesting from kanye and just stopping paying attention stop paying attention but what i'm also hearing you say is that the real freedom in this scenario is our freedom to leave him out there yeah i mean it's sad it's really really sad and the only power that we have as a society is just to say like we do not tolerate this and we don't condone this and that's where we're at with kanye but i do think that it's not about leaving kanye it's about leaving someone who is completely unwilling to be accountable for the harms they're causing and that the only way to inoculate ourselves i was thinking about an infection from its spreading is to quarantine ourselves it hurts it does that's our show still processing is produced by elisa dudley with christina josa
