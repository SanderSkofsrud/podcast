security now i want to tell you a little bit about mileyo photos it's a photo storage actually document storage photos videos and documents that backs up everything you've got puts it on every device you have but most importantly for you our securenow listeners is absolutely secure it does not use the cloud if you don't want it to and if you do and it's up to you it encrypts it steve calls it preegress encryption well we'll call it preinternet encryption for the purposes of this uh many of us rely on our clouds right for digital daytoday many apps and services but they're just not protecting our data as we should it's one of the reasons one of many reasons i am a mileo photos plus user i have according to this two this is my leo 211274 images and 211000 and it does it bog down no it is a place to store them it's automatically doing face recognition i say which who everybody is at first you know that's my wife that's my kids and so forth and then it goes through all the rest of the images matches them beautifully i uh i also tell it uh a few things about location but then it finds it says pictures of churches pictures of churches near an ocean pictures of fish pictures of fish coming out of the river it's amazing it is the best photo categorization tool ever miley of photos plus gives you a single consolidated library for photos videos and other files on your mac on your pc on your android on your iphone everywhere and i have it everywhere it's smart too you could say i just want thumbnails on this one i want originals on the one with the biggest drive and of course when you download from the thumbnail you could download the original at any time you could do some editing in there it makes it effortless to curate to protect to organize and sync your files from anywhere even social media pulls in from instagram from facebook i got all my photos off of google i did google takeout on my google photos myleo photos plus automatically imported it and then deduped it you may say well 211000 photos leo you must have duplicates no not one because myleo has the best deduping and the best part of it is the files stay on my local devices not on distant servers now there is a myleo photos for synology so i actually do have myleo photos copying to my nas for backup but you don't have to in fact miley photos even supports your existing folder structure
