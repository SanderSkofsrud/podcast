It can be uncomfortable, but I feel like it's still absolutely necessary. Race and identity are not just understanding who you are, but who the person in front of you is and wanting to understand more about them. We're trying to wrestle down these really hard subjects and maybe not answering the question but asking the right questions and listening, listening, listening a lot. The Times is dedicated to ambitious and deeply reported coverage of race and identity and they're willing to back it up with resources. If you are curious about the world on which we live, if you're interested in who you are, where you come from, and how you relate to others, I would encourage you to subscribe to The New York Times.",
