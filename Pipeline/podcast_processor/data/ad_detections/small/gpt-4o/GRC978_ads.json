        "text": "wonderful company I've been using for some time, Milio Photos. This is, I think their first time on security now. Now, because it's security now, I want to tell you a little bit about Milio Photos. It's a photo storage, actually document storage, photos, videos, and documents that backs up. Everything you've got puts it on every device you have. But most importantly for you, our secure now listeners is absolutely secure. It does not use the cloud if you don't want it to. And if you do, It's up to you. It encrypts it. Steve calls it pre-egress encryption. We'll call it pre-internet encryption for the purposes of this. Many of us rely on our clouds, right, for digital day-to-day, many apps and services, but they're just not protecting our data as we should. It's one of the reasons, one of many reasons I am a Milio Photos Plus user. I have, according to this, this is Milio, 211,274 images. And 211, and does it bog down? No, it is a place to store them. It's automatically doing face recognition, I say, which everybody is at first, you know, that's my wife, that's my kids and so forth. And then it goes through all the rest of the images, matches them beautifully. I also tell it a few things about location, but then it finds, it says pictures of churches, pictures of churches near an ocean, pictures of fish, pictures of fish coming out of the river. It's amazing. It is the best photo categorization tool ever. MyLeo Photos Plus gives you a single consolidated library for photos, videos, and other files on your Mac, on your PC, on your Android, on your iPhone, everywhere. And I have it everywhere. It's smart too, you could say. I just want thumbnails on this one. I want originals on the one with the biggest drive. And of course, when you download the, from the thumbnail, you can download the original at any time, you could do some editing in there. It makes it effortless to curate, to protect, to organize and sync your files from anywhere. Even social media pulls in from Instagram, from Facebook. I got all my photos off of Google. I did Google takeout on my Google photos. Milio Photos Plus automatically imported it and then dedupted it. You may say, well, 211,000 photos, Leo, you must have duplicates. No, not one, because Myleo has the best de-duping. And the best part of it is the files stay on my local devices, not on distant servers. Now, there is a Myleo photos for Synology, so I actually do have Myleo photos copying to my NAS for backup, but you don't have to. In fact, Myleo photos even supports your existing folder structure, but it does make it much easier to search, curate, and organize your media across all devices. is a privacy-first storage solution that keeps your data local, easy to access, but also ensures you never lose a file. They do have cloud backups. It will work with Google Drive or Microsoft's cloud or your network attached storage, but they're entirely optional. And before it ever goes up to the internet, MyLeo Photos Plus automatically encrypts your data so that no one can see it but you. Even the platform's powerful AI capabilities, that categorization entirely on device. You're not getting data mined and you know if there are companies now who are saying oh yeah by the way if you use our cloud we own your photos. Not Milio because you're not using their cloud. Your photos are your photos. You could tag, you could search for photos using face recognition, amazing object recognition, dogs, cats, but also schnauzers. It really narrows it down. You can use metadata like date and location and none of it is shared unless you want it to be. You've got to love this. It is the most amazing app. So here's my photos. I could prove 211,000. I can look at my local sync policy. So wherever I want optimized quality or original quality, I can also, and I love this, send it to my family history. They support FamilySearch. This is a free service. It supports the LDS library so you can easily get stuff up there. It supports all the photo formats. It does location. In fact, I can even pull up a map of where all my photos have been taken. 49, 46,000 photos have GPS out of the 211,000. And I can pop jump right to that location that I can just go on and on.

        "text": "Security Now is brought to you by, delete me with everything we talk about on this show. It seems pretty clear that privacy is important to you, right? I'm not blowing smoke when I say that. But all you have to do is go out and Google your name, search the internet for your name, and you'll see how little privacy you actually have. And that's probably because of data brokers. The sad thing about data brokers is we still have yet to have a federal law making it illegal, which means it's completely legal for companies, including your ISP, every company you do business with every site you visit to share your personal data with these data brokers. And then these data brokers can completely legally sell it on to anybody who has the money, including foreign governments, our own government and attackers, bad guys. You know, I know this happened. It happened to us. Our CEO, Lisa, reputedly sent out text messages to all her direct reports saying, hey, I'm in a meeting right now. I need you to buy some Amazon gift cards for me and send them along to this address because you know, we want to give them to all the staff for holidays or whatever. Fortunately, her direct reports are smart and didn't fall for it, but it was completely fake. And the thing that was an eye-opener was whoever these bad guys were, they knew who Lisa was. They knew her, her direct reports were, they knew her phone number, they knew their phone number. I mean, the information they needed to make this scam, and it was all available online through data brokers. We immediately signed up for DeleteMe, and I believe you should sign up for DeleteMe. There is only really one good way to stop this, and that's for you to go out and delete all this data from data brokers. Each data broker has a form. You can fill out the law requires it saying take me off your database. But there are hundreds of data brokers. Do you know who they all are? And worse, as soon as you delete it, then they start repopulating it. Oh, that's you? Oh, we didn't know. We just started building an SAA and somebody else. It turned out to be you again. Well, there you go. This is a problem for everybody, including everybody in your family. Delete me now has family plans. Now, I should say that as the adult, you're the one who has to have the delete me account. A minor can't have it. But as the adult, as the administrator of your family plan, you can make sure everyone in your family is safe online, reducing risk from identity theft, from cyber security threats, like I just described, fishing, scams, harassment, and more. Delete Me's experts will find and remove your data from hundreds of data brokers. Each member of your family can have a data sheet tailored to them so you can easily control what it is that is being deleted, what they should be looking for as the account owner. You manage the privacy settings for the whole family. And then as I said, DeleteMe will not only delete it initially, but they'll continue to scan and remove your information regularly. I'm talking everything. Addresses, phone numbers, emails, photos, relatives, social media accounts, property value. Protect yourself, reclaim your privacy, visit joindeleteme.com slash tweet. offer code we have for you is TWIT TWIT that will save you 20% off all privacy plans including that family plan.

I am very interested. But first, this portion of the show brought to you by Collide. I've talked about Collide with you before. You know that is the company that puts users first, that gets users to be part of your security team. Collide works with companies that use Okta for user authentication. It adds that extra step, the hardware and software authentication to make sure that your known users are entering with known secure devices. And maybe you heard Let me tell you that Collide was purchased by one password. Kind of a, you know, a happy surprise. It's big news. Both companies really focus on leading the industry and creating security solutions that put users first. Different areas, passwords versus authentication, but you know, that's kind of related, aren't they? For over a year, Collide Device Trust has helped companies with OCTO ensure that only known and secured devices can access their data. They're still doing that. they're just doing it with one password. It's actually a match made in heaven, a real synergy. If you've got octa and you've been thinking, ah, I'm really gonna check out Collide and Uota, this is the best time possible. There's no better time.
