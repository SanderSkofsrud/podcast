But all you have to do is go out and Google your name, search see it in F for your name, and you'll see how little privacy you actually have. And that's probably because of data brokers. The sad thing about data brokers is we still have yet to have a federal law making it illegal, which means it's completely legal for companies, including your ISP and for company to do business with, every site you visit, to share your personal data with these data brokers. And then these data brokers can completely legally sell it on to anybody who has the money, including foreign governments, our own government, and attackers, bad guys. know this happened, it happened to us. Our CEO, you know, Lisa, repeatedly sent out text messages to all her director reports saying, hey, I'm in a meeting right now. I need you to buy some Amazon gift cards for me and send them along to this address because you don't want to give them to all the staff for holidays or whatever. Fortunately, her director reports are smart and didn't fall for it, but it was completely fake. And the thing that was an eye My opener was whoever these bad guys were, they knew who Lisa was, they knew who her direct reports were, they knew her phone number, they knew their phone number. I mean the information they needed to make this scam and it was all available online through data brokers. We immediately signed up for Delete Me and I believe you should sign up for Delete Me. There is only really one good way to stop this and that's for you to go out and delete all this data from data brokers. Each data broker has a form. You can fill out the law requires it, saying, take me off your database. But there are hundreds of data brokers do you know who they all are? And worse, as soon as you delete it, then they start repopulating it. Oh, that's you? Oh, we didn't know. We just started building an OCA and somebody else. It turned out to be you again. Well, there you go. This is a problem for everybody, including everybody in your family. Delete me now has family plans.

So you can easily control what it is that, you know, this being deleted, what they should be looking for as the account owner you managed the privacy settings for the whole family.
