        "text": "Mileyo Photos. This is, I think, their first time on security now. Now, because it's security now, I want to tell you a little bit about Mileyo Photos. It's a photo storage, actually document storage, photos, videos, and documents that backs up everything you've got, puts it on every device you have. But most importantly for you, our SecureNow listeners, is absolutely secure. It does not use the cloud if you don't want it to. And if you do, and it's up to you it encrypts it steve calls it pre-egress encryption well we'll call it pre-internet encryption for the purposes of this. Many of us rely on our clouds right for digital day-to-day many apps and services but they're just not protecting our data as we should it's one of the reasons one of many reasons I am a mileo photos plus user. I have according to this two this is my Leo, 211,274 images and 211,000. And it does it bog down? No, it is a place to store them. It's automatically doing face recognition. I say, which who everybody is at first, you know, that's my wife, that's my kids and so forth. And then it goes through all the rest of the images, matches them beautifully. I, uh, I also tell it, uh, a few things about location, but then it finds, it says pictures of churches, pictures of churches near an ocean, pictures of fish, pictures of fish coming out of the river. It's amazing. It is the best photo categorization tool ever. Miley of Photos Plus gives you a single consolidated library for photos, videos, and other files on your Mac, on your PC, on your Android, on your iPhone, everywhere. And I have it everywhere. It's smart, too. You could say, I just want thumbnails on this one. I want originals on the one with the biggest drive. And, of course, when you download from the thumbnail, you could download the original at any time. You could do some editing in there. It makes it effortless to curate, to protect, to organize and sync your files from anywhere. Even social media pulls in from Instagram, from Facebook. I got all my photos off of Google. I did Google takeout on my Google Photos. MyLeo Photos Plus automatically imported it and then deduped it. You may say, well, 211,000 photos, Leo, you must have duplicates. No, not one, because MyLeo has the best deduping. And the best part of it is the files stay on my local devices, not on distant servers. Now, there is a MyLeo Photos for Synology, so I actually do have MyLeo Photos copying to my NAS for backup. But you don't have to. In fact, Miley Photos even supports your existing folder structure, but it does make it much easier to search, curate, and organize your media across all devices. It's a privacy-first storage solution that keeps your data local, easy to access, but also ensures you never lose a file. They do have cloud backups. It will work with Google Drive or Microsoft's cloud or your network-attached storage, but they're entirely optional. And before it ever goes up to the internet, Miley of Photos Plus automatically encrypts your data so that no one can see it but you. Even the platform's powerful AI capabilities, all that categorization, entirely on device. You're not getting data mined. And you know, there are companies now who are saying, oh yeah, by the way, if you use our cloud, we own your photos, Adobe. Not Miley, because you're not using their cloud. Your photos are your photos. You could tag, you could search for photos using face recognition, amazing object recognition, dogs, cats, but also schnauzers. You can, it really narrows it down. You can use metadata like date and location, and none of it is shared unless you want it to be. You've got to love this. It is the most amazing app. So here's my photos. I can prove 211,000.

        "text": "Delete Me. With everything we talk about on this show, it seems pretty clear that privacy is important to you, right? I'm not blowing smoke when I say that. But all you have to do is go out and Google your name, search the Internet for your name, and you'll see how little privacy you actually have. And that's probably because of data brokers. The sad thing about data brokers is we still have yet to have a federal law making it illegal, which means it's completely legal for companies, including your ISP, every company you do business with, every site you visit, to share your personal data with these data brokers. And then these data brokers can completely legally sell it on to anybody who has the money, including foreign governments, our own government, and attackers, bad guys. You know, I know this happened. It happened to us. Our CEO, you know, Lisa reputedly sent out text messages to all her direct reports saying, hey, I'm in a meeting right now. I need you to buy some Amazon gift cards for me and send them along to this address because, you know, we want to give them to all the staff for holidays or whatever. Fortunately, her direct reports are smart and didn't fall for it, but it was completely fake. And the thing that was an eye opener was whoever these bad guys were, they knew who Lisa was. They knew who her direct reports were. They knew her phone number. They knew their phone number. I mean, the information they needed to make this scam, and it was all available online through data brokers. We immediately signed up for Delete Me, and I believe you should sign up for Delete Me. There is only really one good way to stop this, and that's for you to go out and delete all this data from data brokers. Each data broker has a form you can fill out. The law requires it saying, take me off your database. But there are hundreds of data brokers. Do you know who they all are? And worse, as soon as you delete it, then they start repopulating it. Oh, that's you? Oh, we didn't know. We just started building an OCA on somebody else. It turned out to be you again. Well, there you go. This is a problem for everybody, including everybody in your family. DeleteMe now has family plans. Now, I should say that as the adult, you're the one who has to have the Delete Me account. A minor can't have it. But as the adult, as the administrator of your family plan, you can make sure everyone in your family is safe online, reducing risk from identity theft, from cybersecurity threats like I just described, phishing, scams, harassment, and more. Delete Me's experts will find and remove your data from hundreds of data brokers. Each member of your family can have a data sheet tailored to them. So you can easily control what it is that is being deleted, what they should be looking for. As the account owner, you manage the privacy settings for the whole family. And then, as I said, Delete Me will not only delete it initially, but they'll continue to scan and remove your information regularly. I'm talking everything. addresses phone numbers emails photos relatives social media accounts property value protect yourself reclaim your privacy visit join delete me dot com slash twit the offer code we have for you is twit t-w-i-t that will save you 20 off all privacy plans including that family plan. That's joindelete.com slash twit. Don't forget the offer code TWIT for 20% off. This is something we did immediately because it was just obvious we had a problem. If you're a business, you should have delete me for all your managers. It's like vital to your security.",

        "text": "Collide. I've talked about Collide with you before. You know that as the company that puts users first, that gets users to be part of your security team. Collide works with companies that use Okta for our user authentication. It adds that extra step, the hardware and software authentication to make sure that your known users are entering with known secure devices. And maybe you heard me tell you that Collide was purchased by 1Password. Kind of a, you know, a happy surprise. It's big news. Both companies really focus on leading the industry and creating security solutions that put users first. Different areas, passwords versus authentication, but, you know, that's kind of related, aren't they? For over a year, Collide Device Trust has helped companies with Okta to ensure that only known and secured devices can access their data. They're still doing that. They're just doing it with one password. It's actually a match made in heaven, a real synergy. If you've got Okta and you've been thinking, I really ought to check out Collide and you ought to, this is the best time possible. There's no better time. And by the way, very easy to get up and running with Collide. I've heard people say, oh, is this going to be complicated? No. Collide comes with a complete library of pre-built device posture checks, all the stuff you know you want, you know, operating system up to date, browsers up to date, that kind of thing. And then it's very easy to write your own custom checks for stuff that's specific to your situation. Pretty much anything you can think of. And here's a nice feature. You can use Collide in devices without MDM, which means your entire Linux fleet. It means contractor devices and every single one of those BYOD devices, the phones and the laptops in your company. Now that Collide is part of 1Password, it's just going to get better. So just to reassure you, this is great news.
