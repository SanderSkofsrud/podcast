it's time for security now steve gibson is here he has a rebuttal to microsoft's rebuttal to last week's accusation all about microsoft recall he still says it might want to hold off on that one apple gets a password manager is it good enough for government work i will also talk about the use of ai encoding is ai going to kill the future of code and what microsoft did when they had a little error that's ended up becoming a very useful tool to go after bad guys so coming up next i'm security now podcasts you love from people you trust this is twitter this is security now with steve gibson episode 978 recorded tuesday june 11th 2024 the rise and fall of code that microsoft's dot com it's time for security now to show you weight all week for as steve says it's tuesday it must be steve gibson hello steve hello leo we're out walking with some friends around the neighborhood yesterday and i i i there's like three long legs of our community and after doing two of them they we all started down the third and i said well no it's podcast night i got to get back to work it on the podcast so i got the walk was cut short and uh laurie had been pushing me to start earlier on mondays because i was i would be trying to get worked on in through the mornings but invariably it would creep into the afternoon and then i'd be like oh shoot i should have been i should be further along so now i'm just not even trying to get anything done on monday except work on the podcast now that's the that's the the driving force we were seeing the result of that today because we have 24 pages of show notes as it consequence of me having gotten the next or early start yesterday now normally the people who listen to us at 15x do so because i kind of plot along there'll be no plotting today because we have a lot of ground to cover so if you are hearing me at 15x and wondering why i seem to be going a little faster than usual you might want to consider dropping down to 1x and hearing it at normal speed we got a bunch of things to talk about on today's podcast 978 for patch tuesday i am mourning the fact and if one of our listeners is listening someone tweeted me a couple weeks ago this picture of a pipe that had just had patches all over it like crazy and silver like screw on straps and it looked like this thing was on life support i thought that is the most perfect picture of the week for microsoft patch tuesday but i don't know what happened of the picture so maybe if the person is listing you can send it to me again because and i'll hold it for july's patch tuesday we're going to talk about something really interesting which is i titled this the rise and fall of code dot microsoft dot com which everyone would recognize as a subdomain the code subdomain of microsoftcom what they essentially the way what happened started was with an architectural failure the scope of which i can hardly grasp i have no idea what's going on up there in that what i will describe could have happened but it did but they turned it around i mean they still have some problems to solve but they managed to repurpose this mistake into something that ended up creating a ton of intelligence for them collecting a ton of intelligence anyway we're going to have a lot of fun with that the first we're going to talk about how microsoft has responded to the title wave of criticism that they've received over recall and what about google who else recently lost control of their data apple devices will be getting a password manager what what about i cloud i thought we already had that is that a drone recording a wedding or is it the chinese communist party surveillance device what did slash date as survey of more than 10000 coders around the world reveal about their use of ai today and their choice of language and if ai's concoed which they see mayble to do then what's the career future for programmers we have some feedback on that also why has the linux project the linux kernel project suddenly begun spewing cves in great number will we be able to order pizza in the future or should we just give up now or maybe order all your pizza today and freeze it what did one listener discover when he attempted to register his new pasc key devices across the internet as i said how did a stunning mistake at microsoft turn into a gold mine of attacker intelligence so not a slow podcast today for the second podcast of june we know microsoft never makes any mistakes oh the way to hear this one oh i just when i read this i thought and this is from them this is their own blog posting somebody confessed this which i first bought though but like really well i know i will get there we'll get there it's stunning i know we got 26 pages so let me hurry up here and tell you about our first sponsor of the show today wonderful company i've been using for some time my leo photos this is i think they're first time on security now now well because it's security now i want to tell you a little bit of a myelia photos it's a photo storage actually document storage photos videos and documents that backs up everything you've got puts it on every device you have but most importantly for you our secure nail listeners is absolutely secure it does not use the cloud if you don't want it to and if you do it's up to you it encrypts it steve calls it preegress encryption well we'll go up three internet grison for the purposes of this many of us rely on our clouds right for digital data they many apps and services but they're just not protecting our data as we should it's one of the reasons one of many reasons i am a milio photos plus user i have according to this too this is milio 211274 images in 211000000 and it does it bogged down and it does it bogged down no it is a place to store them it's automatically doing face recognition i say which who everybody is at first you know that's my wife that's my kids and so forth and then it goes through all the rest of the images matches them beautifully i also tell it a few things about location but then it finds it says pictures of churches pictures of churches near an ocean pictures of fish pictures of fish coming out of the river it's amazing it is the best photo categorization tool ever my leo photos plus gives you a single consolidated library for photos videos and other files on your mac on your pc on your android on your iphone everywhere and i have it everywhere it's smart too you could say i just want thumbnails on this one i want originals on the one with the biggest drive and of course when you download the from the thumbnail you can download the original at any time you could do some editing in there it makes it effortless to curate to protect to organize and sync your files from anywhere even social media pulls in from instagram from facebook i got all my photos off of google i did google take out on my google photos myleo photos plus automatically imported and then dedupt it you may say well turn it 11000 photos leo you must have duplicates no not one because my leo is the best ddoping and the best part of it is the file stay on my local devices not on distant servers now there is a myleo photos for synology so i actually do have myleo photos copying to my nas for backup but you don't have to in fact myleo photos even support your existing folder structure but it does make it much easier to search curate and organize your media across all devices it's a privacy first storage solution that keeps your data local easy to access but also ensures you never lose a file they do have cloud backups it will work with google drive or microsoft's cloud or your network attached storage but they're entirely optional and before it ever goes up to the internet my layout photos plus automatically encrypts your data so that no one can see it but you even the platforms powerful ai capabilities all that categorization entirely on device you're not getting dataminded and you know there are companies now who are saying oh yeah by the way if you use our cloud we own your photos that'll be not my only because you're not using their cloud your photos are your photos you could tag you could search for photos using face recognition amazing object recognition dogs cats but also shannowsers you can really narrow it down you can use metadata like date and location and none of it is shared unless you want it to be you've got to love this it is the most amazing app so here's my photos i could prove 211000 i can look at my local sync policy so wherever i want optimized quality or original quality i can also and i love this send it to my family history they support family search this is a free service it supports the lds library so you can easily get stuff up there it supports all the photo formats it does location in fact i can even pull up a map if we're all my photos have been taken 49 46000 photos have gps out of the 211000 and i can pop jump right to that location that i can just go on and on this is the best tool ever not just photos it does ocr on documents it takes videos too most important for you the security and aliciner's privacy first get it today myleo photos plus to help you get started we've got a great offer your first month is free it's 99 for your first year of myleo photos plus by the way i immediately subscribed because i thought this is too great but we've got a special deal right now your first month is free at mwhlocom slashtwit i've heard me talk about this i suspect i can go on and on this has this is one of the deepest pieces of software i've ever used and it gets better day by day they add new features there's no way i could tell you everything you can do and want to add check it out it is amazing milio photos at myleocom slash to it i don't know how to recommend it more entirely and wholeheartedly it is amazing it's where i store everything now all right back to it's speaking of photos you're picture of the week steve so we've had endless fun with these bizarre pictures of like if gate blocking a path where there's open grass on either sides of it it's like what what what you just just like what were they thinking anyway somebody had fun over the microsand soft recall issue and actually relative to their most recent update this titled the this titled microsoft recall and then it shows us one of the pictures that we've shown before a bright yellow gate in the middle of a walkway but you know with actually some it looks like there actually is footpath traffic on either side because the grass is you know patted down in a little brown anyway the bottom it says referring to the skate don't worry it's encrypted yeah right i'll have well actually right now last friday mary jo fully yes right our mary jo of windows weekly fame she tweeted microsoft bally into growing security centric criticism is making some tweaks to its coming windows 11 24h2 recall app the first copilot plus pcs are still on track to start shipping june 18th okay now today is june 11th so that's one week from today folks and she said and the tweaks are slated to take effect by then too okay so she was referring of course to a microsoft windows blog that is when she said microsoft bowing to security center concerns posted by the corporate vice president for windows plus devices so it appears that windows plus devices are a category so that would presumably mean copilot plus anyway this guy posted under the title update on the recall preview feature for copilot plus pcs and as mary jo noted this is clearly in response to the security industry's reaction over the previous three weeks to the privacy implications that would be present my contention is and i'll be echoing this a couple other times today in any system that aggregates for all time everything a user does on their pc okay and i'll have a little more to say specifically about that in a moment but first first let's hear from microsoft since a lot of the danger recall represents as reflected by microsoft's attitude toward recall i want to share this vps entire post it's not very long but it's important that they're attitude be seen so bear with me at the start since it's pure microsoft marketing speak anyway everyone will recognize it as such he wrote today we're sharing an update on the recall feature in preview for copilot plus pcs including more information on the setup experience privacy controls and additional details on our approach to security on may 20th we introduced copilot plus pcs our fastest most intelligent windows pcs ever copilot plus pcs have been reimaged from the inside out to deliver better performance and all new ai experiences to help you be more productive creative and communicate more effectively one of the new experiences exclusive to copilot plus pcs thank god is recall a new way to instantly find something you've previously seen on your pc to create an explorable visual timeline recall periodically takes a snapshot of what appears on your screen these images are encrypted stored and analyzed locally using ondevice ai capabilities to understand loosely termed right they're context okay he says when logged into your copilot plus pc you can easily retrace your steps visually using recall to find things from apps websites images and documents that you've seen operating like your own virtual and completely private photographic memory you're always in control of what's saved you can disable saving snapshots pause temporarily filter applications and delete your snapshots at any time as ai becomes more prevalent we're rearchitecting windows really like there are dialogues from windows 95 that pop up every so often in windows 11 so right all we've ever seen is some you know paving over the previous pavement which was over the pavement before that and so on so okay rearchitecting windows to give customers and developers more choice to leverage both the cloud and the power of local processing on the device may possible by the neural processing unit the npu this distributed computing model offers choice for both privacy and security all of this work will continue to be guided by our secure future initiative sfi our team is driven by a relentless desire to to empower people through the transformative potential of ai and we see great utility and recall and the problem it can solve we also know for people to get the full value of the experiences like recall they have to trust it that's why we are launching recall in preview on copilot plus pcs to give customers a choice to engage with the feature early or not and to give us an opportunity to learn from the types of real world scenarios customers and the windows community finds most useful okay so under the subhead of listening to an acting on customer feedback he wrote even before making recall available to customers we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable recall on their copilot plus pc and improve privacy and security safeguards with that in mind we are announcing updates that will go into effect before the recall preview ships to customers on june 18 so like as mary jo said right now before next week so first he said we are updating the setup experience of copilot plus pcs to give people a clearer choice to opt in to saving snapshots using recall he said if you don't proactively choose to turn it on it will be off by default so that's a big change and that matters the flip side is how much does it really matter you know we've seen how persistent seductive and eventually forceful microsoft can be when they want to push their users in a certain direction it's not that difficult to imagine that while the user might need to switch it on microsoft will not be cautioning the user about the systems inherent dangers rather they will be promoting the benefits and touting encryption locality security and all the rest i believe the upshot will be that users will turn it on if nothing less just to see what it's about because microsoft will be making it very appealing but still if nothing else having people turn it on probably gets them off the hook when things go wrong after all well we didn't ship it with it on you turn it on and it's like yes because you told me to okay anyway second windows hello enrollment is required to enable recall in addition proof of presence is also required to view your timeline and search and recall okay so that's these are all good things right they've created additional hurdles barriers requirements in order to gain access to this and i'll just note through the front door like gain access the way you're supposed to they're not talking about gaining access the way you're not supposed to we'll see how that turns out and third he said we're adding additional layers of data protection including just in time decryption protected by windows hello enhanced signin security so recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates on the other hand okay anyway finally he said in addition we encrypted this search index database which wasn't originally decrypted so finally he says secure by design and secure by default in line with microsoft's sfi that's the secure initiative thing principles before the preview release of recall to customers we're taking steps to increase data protection copilot plus pcs will launch with just in time decryption protected by windows hello and handssign in security so recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates this gives an additional layer of protection to recall data in addition to other default enabled windows security features like smart screen and defender which use advanced ai techniques to help prevent malware from accessing data like recall now okay remember that last week kevin beaumont deliberately used known to microsoft info stealer malware which windows defender was so slow to recognize that the info stealer had already successfully infiltrated the user's entire recall history before defender woke up and shut it down so we should again the problem is microsoft's heart being in the right place does it help anybody because windows as we know is it's not an exaggeration to say riddled with vulnerabilities because you know more than a hundred are being fixed today in in this in today's windows update okay anyway he said we also know the best way to secure information on a pc is to secure the whole pc itself right because that's been going so well and he said we want to reinforce what has previously been shared from david weston vice president of enterprise and os security about how coal pilot plus pcs have been designed to be secure by default and share additional details about our security approach in other words unlike all of our previous windows systems which really weren't all that secure even though we've all used told you they were but oh baby this time we really and truly mean it not like all those previous times so he said some notable examples of security enhancements include all copilot plus pcs will be secured core pcs bringing which doesn't matter if the windows that runs on it isn't secure but he said bringing advanced security to both commercial and consumer devices in addition to the layers of protection in windows 11 secured core pcs provided advanced firmware safeguards and dynamic root of trust measurement to help protect from chip to cloud and that's a new phrase that microsoft is using from chip to cloud which you know from what cradle to grave that's right also microsoft pluton security processor will be enabled by default or goody on all copilot plus pcs pluton is a chip to cloud security technology designed by microsoft and built by silicon partners with zero trust principles at the core this helps protect credentials identities personal data and encryption keys making them significantly harder to remove from the device even if a user is tricked into installing malware or an attacker has physical possession of a pc again unfortunately making sure that a buggy operating system is an altered before it boots or while it's booting doesn't help you once the buggy operating system is running but at least it didn't get compromised before a booted who cares haha anyway he said all coal pilot plus pcs will ship with windows hello enhanced hello enhanced sight insecurity this provides more secure biometric sightings and eliminates the need for a password because yeah who wants those passwords when you can smile at it okay under the headline protecting your privacy on coal pilot plus pcs we have in in our early internal testing we've seen different people use recall in the way that works best for them blah blah blah blah let's skip all this because we don't have a lot of time and this is just all same stuff he's basically saying okay we heard you we're going to turn it off by default we're going to seduce people to turn it on but if they do it's their fault not hours because after all they were the ones who turned it on and oh baby you know this is the most secure thing we've ever made so again as i said before we've always we've always told you that remember bomber jumping around on stage about windows xp which turned out to be the worst security of any operating system to date that they'd had anyway so basically they're saying we heard you and here are all the reasons why we're going to keep doing what we were doing except we're going to turn off by default as i get out of jail free card so anyway we know that users will be impressed by the sounds of all this security and i have no doubt that users are going to want to have the power that this provides don't get me wrong i mean i i get it this is a seductive feature and that's part of why this is a doubleedged sword you know make them no mistake about it this is powerful but it's because it's powerful that it's also so dangerous and brings the potential for great harm will that harm come to pass well we'll be here to see i should also note that i've been asked by a number of our listeners whether i would consider creating some sort of utility that absolutely positively guarantees that recall is not running on a machine we'll see how all this goes but i am inclined to do so and if so i know what i'll call it and leo i will make sure you're not sipping coffee when i reveal its name okay i put the coffee down okay because yeah and you'll have to set yourself over your ball because you're going to love this one anyway we'll see how it goes kevin beaumont also weighed in on microsoft's revised explanation he posted this on masterdawn he said obviously i recommend you do not enable recall and tell your family not to enable it too it's still labeled a preview and i'll believe it is encrypted when i see it there are obviously serious governance and security failures at microsoft around how this played out that need to be investigated and suggests they are not serious about ai safety and i think that raises a really good point it's like you know they announced this and we saw such a jumping up and down talking about how great it was gonna be and the entire security community had a collective meltdown so that tells you something about like why they need to have this in people's machines which again comes back to my theory about what they're actually planning which is that this will be used to train a some sort of high power local assistant and again i get it i mean that would be so cool but they've never demonstrated their ability to do anything like this safely i should mention that google with their chrome os is also in on the store everything that happens for possible later use bandwagon everyone can sense that there's huge potential here somewhere so no one wants to be left out last week john solomon goules vp in charge of the kromo s said that they're so called memory feature okay they may be talked to apple about naming things as that that's what they're currently unofficially calling it is different from recall okay but that he describes recall he says because users will have a control of how and where the memory feature works right just like recall they'll offer so not so different from recall and after all if you turn it off then you're not going to get it so people are not going to turn off they're going to have it on if they want it and then suffer the consequences if there are any anyway google apparently already wants to distance itself from the stink surrounding the announcement of recall the new york times on the topic of is it possible to keep secrets last friday 270 gigabytes of data belonging to the new york times which i'm quite certain the new york times wanted to keep secure and secret and which those in charge of securing it were absolutely impossitively certain was completely secure until it wasn't you know just like microsoft is absolutely and positively certain they're going to secure their users' recall data until they don't in the case of the new york times it got loose an unknown threat actor leaked the new york times source code as in all of it all 270 gigabytes of it after one of the company's it guys apparently left a private github access token in a public code paste the leaked data includes the source code of the company's entire public website mobile apps and even for those who are interested it's worldgame the 270 gigabytes of data being made available on the dark web is mostly unincrypted the hacker posted quote basically all source code belonging to the new york times company 270 gigabytes are around 5000 repos out of them less than 30 are additionally encrypted i think he said 36 million files total uncompressed tar and i have a picture in the screen in our show notes of the screen that was posted on the dark web with the series of links so that youtube can and download 270 gigabytes and find out what the new york times coders have been up to the lesson here is that unfortunately mistakes happen in fact leo where are we to rename this podcast it would be mistakes that happen yes that's the whole story right there no yeah we've seen stories of valuable exposed credentials sitting unnoticed for years right where like like some hacker came along and saw that a credential had been post in publicly but nobody noticed until now one real concern for the future against the background of mistakes happen is that there may soon be if there aren't already malicious ai driven bots scanning and rifling through the internet looking for any fresh mistakes of value that anyone may have made the point is our world is changing right underneath us right now and i'm not sure the good guys are winning it you know this whole thing feels somewhat asymmetric right because i mean as we know security is about a series of links and we keep seeming to add more links to the chain any one of which being defective can break the entire strength of the chain again it feels like an asymmetric fight that we are not clearly getting at this point pretty much losing i think would be fair all right how about this you can't recall or recall recall oh no no i mean i almost have to do the app just so i could use this name it is recall what okay i can't wait it'll be fun let's take a break lee okay security now is brought to you by delete me with everything we talk about on this show it seems pretty clear that privacy is important to you i'm not blowing smoke when i say that but all you have to do is go out and google your name search see it in f for your name and you'll see how little privacy you actually have and that's probably because of data brokers the sad thing about data brokers is we still have yet to have a federal law making it illegal which means it's completely legal for companies including your isp and for company to do business with every site you visit to share your personal data with these data brokers and then these data brokers can completely legally sell it on to anybody who has the money including foreign governments our own government and attackers bad guys know this happened it happened to us our ceo you know lisa repeatedly sent out text messages to all her director reports saying hey i'm in a meeting right now i need you to buy some amazon gift cards for me and send them along to this address because you don't want to give them to all the staff for holidays or whatever fortunately her director reports are smart and didn't fall for it but it was completely fake and the thing that was an eye my opener was whoever these bad guys were they knew who lisa was they knew who her direct reports were they knew her phone number they knew their phone number i mean the information they needed to make this scam and it was all available online through data brokers we immediately signed up for delete me and i believe you should sign up for delete me there is only really one good way to stop this and that's for you to go out and delete all this data from data brokers each data broker has a form you can fill out the law requires it saying take me off your database but there are hundreds of data brokers do you know who they all are and worse as soon as you delete it then they start repopulating it oh that's you oh we didn't know we just started building an oca and somebody else it turned out to be you again well there you go this is a problem for everybody including everybody in your family delete me now has family plans now i should say that as the adult you're the one who has to have to delete me account a minor can't have it but as the adult as the administrator of your family plan you can make sure everyone in your family is safe online reducing risk from identity theft from cybersecurity threats like i just described fishing scams harassment and more delete me's experts will find and remove your data from hundreds of data brokers each member of your family can have a data sheet tailored to them so you can easily control what it is that you know this being deleted what they should be looking for as the account owner you managed the privacy settings for the whole family and then as i said delete me will not only delete it initially but they'll continue to scan and remove your information regularly i'm talking to everything address is phone numbers emails photos relatives social media accounts property value protect yourself reclaim your privacy visit joindeletemecom slash twitter the offer code we have for you is twitter twit that will save you 20 off all privacy plans including that family plan that's joindeletemecom slash twitter don't forget the offer code twit for 20 off this is something we did immediately because it was just obvious we had a problem if you're a business you should have delete me for all your managers it's like vital to your security join deletemecom slash twitter the offer code twit gets you 20 off all right steve let's continue on so and i know you'll have something to say about this one leo during yesterday's worldwide developer conference or the kickoff apple introduced their forthcoming passwords app now of course apple users have long been using their icloud account the store and sink their passwords among their devices but what was going on wasn't super transparent no it just worked without a clear and clean ui it was necessary to dig down into the control app to locate a subpage so the passwords app that will be included in the next major release of their os's so that would be ios 18 mac os sequoia and vision os 2 will provide a ui for apple's storage of this information now since this is not ever going to be a crossecosystem solution you know it's apple only those of us it's windows well yeah and i heard you say something about how to cloud for windows yes we're to app anyway i'll just finish and say that those of us using windows linux or android will likely remain with whatever crossecosystem solution solution we're using today but this move does create an explicit and native password manager for apple os's for the first time and if someone is 100 pure apple world it likely offers everything anyone would need it also incorporates clear past keys management and a builtin one time password style authenticator since i'm currently using otp off as my one time password authenticator of choice i'll look at what apple has to offer once i upgrade my iphone to something that will run ios 18 i think i'm stuck back on 12 or something right now but so leo what is the i hear that you guys using the word sure locked where did that come from so way back in the day i mean i think this is 20 years ago there was an app called sherlock that let you find files on your device it was really good you could you know you'd make an index and you'd sherlock and you could find anything on your hard drive then apple released something it calls spotlight and sherlock was at a business overnight and so ever after when apple introduces a product the duplicate functionality of a third party product and essentially puts him out of business we call it being sherlock and there were all i mean obviously one password bit warden and other password managers there's a sherlock festival yes may have been sherlock by the spassards but it was just one of many exactly yes now now we've seen microsoft do the same thing too right like i was complaining that it took until service pack three for windows xp's firewall to be enabled by default back at the time remember zone alarm was my favorite firewall and there was a firewall industry exactly sure windows pc yep and then well microsoft says you know we're going to put a firewall in but don't you worry it'll be turned off by default well it eventually got turned on and i was just talking to a friend of mine the other day who was asking me if she needed to be still using macophie and i said oh lord no i said you know windows built in defender is really all anybody needs and i explained that microsoft does this they they sort of create the capability but they don't want to step on anyone's toes so they sort of ease it into the world slowly microsoft i would argue is a little less caretaking about that they say yeah now we're doing that so yeah anyway yeah and again it makes sense for this thing to get moved in so there is an oh and how i cloud for windows how can you use a password manager for apple under i cloud for windows because i mean it's just i thought it was just folders oh no no no i cloud for windows let's you do a lot of things and including i guess now access your passwords actually if that's been around it is not as elegant as a password manager and remember this is gonna do passkeys right but i don't know and they didn't really say i think the passkeys are hardware dependent which means it seems unlikely passkeys would make it over to windows but they might do what they do now which will show you qr code and then the phone that you have the passkey on you'd right do the qr code so is it gonna be as full featured as a standalone passerman you're probably not that's often the case well it's thing and i'm multiplatform so you and i will use it i can't i'm android and windows and linux right but by the way a lot of people and you know what i love this because it means a lot of nonsophisticated users will just do it because it's part of the operating system it's people's yeah and i think it it for it the fact that they're showing it as a separate thing you know helps to raise people's awareness of passwords and the various aspects of passwords like past keys and one time passwords and so forth you know it just you know it brings it more to light which has got to be a good thing yeah um i saw some talk a while back about some congressional pushback on chinese made drones by dji you know when those dji drones are by far the best drone technology around in advance of the us senate's plan discussion of the socalled countering ccp drones act which will limit the use of chinese made drones in the us on the grounds of national security tomorrow june 12th dji will be disabling the ability of users in the us to sink their drone flight data to its servers and the option to sink us drone data at all will be completely removed by the end of the month so dji is seeing what's going on with tiktok and this general sort of concern over what the chinese communist party is doing with technology that us consumers are excited about and so i'm sure they don't want to lose this market so they're saying okay fine we're going to strip this out of our devices so i don't know what a problem that will be for dji users if being able to sync drone flight data to servers is a big deal but it'll be gone by the end of the month okay another thing that leo i think you're going to get a kick out of seeing although you and i are not represented among these statistics slash data revealed some interesting developers' statistics they recently surveyed 10000 developers from more than 135 countries the question put to them was quote how has ai affected your workflow okay now let me first allow slash dot to introduce themselves they wrote if this is the first time you heard about slash data if this is the first time you heard about slash data i'm happy to share a few quick words rights the person who posted this slashdata is a developer research company every quarter slashdata runs a survey on the developer's global developer audience to measure the pulse of the developer ecosystem and how they feel about new technologies tools platforms the support from developer programs and more following the closing of the survey our expert analysts work to identify key trends and translate raw data into actionable insights that professionals and companies addressing a developer audience can utilize to find to in their strategy and address developers needs and wants the 26th edition of the developer nation survey reached more than 10000 respondents from 135 countries around the world slash data announces the first two of the six report series that are coming widely available to the world showcasing and dividing into key and diving into key developer trends for 2024 and beyond each report focuses on a specific topic all reports published under the slate of the developer nation will be accessible under freshly launched slash data research space free access for reviewing and downloading okay so the first two chunks are interesting the first is how ai has impacted development and the second is the everpopular which programming language do you use so first off ai they said how developers interact with ai technologies has ai taken over the world not yet they write however it has already achieved a takeover of all our discussions about the future indeed it has and they said 59 of developers report that they're now using ai tools in their development workflows this report investigates the current landscape of developers work with artificial intelligence technologies and how this impacts their careers we start by looking at the ways in which developers work with machine learning models tools apis and services and highlight the key differences between professional and amateur developers and they go on so on the ai front we first have four broad categories and lee i've got a chart at the top of page nine of the show notes four broad categories 59 report using ai in their own development workflows 25 are adding ai functions into applications and 13 are actively involved in creating ai models this leaves only 29 whose development work has not yet been touched by ai in any of those ways so yeah among the 59 so more than half and fewer than two thirds i'm in that still many by the way i have a ai that helps me with my coding yes yes so 59 who are now actively using ai tools in their development workflows 42 almost a half are using chat bots to obtain answers to coding questions this is globally out of 10000 developed more than 10000 developers surveyed 42 are using chat bots to obtain answers to coding questions 27 are using development tools that have ai assistance built in and 19 are using generative ai to help generate creative assets if coding was a monday through friday 9 to 5 job which i was doing to earn my living where i was being judged by my own productivity against my peers then yeah i'd be quite happy to get quick answers to questions about how to do this or that from a chatbot ai you know rather than searching around the internet looking for someone like uh uh uh it let like you know wherever on the internet yeah extacus changes the name i just tried to remember a stack is change who has who has posted something similar to learn from i'd be happy to ask a smart bot you know what it had found from previously doing essentially the same thing there's no shame there and it's clear that many coders agree okay i use it instead of flipping through manuals yes almost universally this stuff that's on stack exchange is useless but i still have to i mean i don't code enough to remember every in the language i use as massive commonless so this isn't in lieu of looking through manuals it's very useful yep very useful yep so what's being so so what's going on with the use of programming languages i have a chart there at the bottom of page nine the survey revealed that by far the number one language in use today is javascript oh yeah that's for sure yep web programming the current total is estimated to be 252 million javascript coders wow with that number having grown by 4 million just over the past year so 252 million javascript coders in the number two slot is python at 182 million it's probably about a couple of years no but yes just one language so right right python at 182 million which is just a bit ahead of java at 177 million in third place behind those top three is c at 116 c sharp at 102 php at a respectable 98 million visual development tools at 72 million followed by plain old c language at 65 then instead of decreasing numbers we have kotlin go swift rust dart objective see ruby and lua and you know leo there's no sign of lisp or assembly language on this chart what do you suppose that means that neither of the two languages would you and i have chosen to use lisp and a simpler respectively are in the running here we're just smarter than the masses that's all there is to it you know i think part of it is that we're able to choose the language we can most want to code right that's right we don't have any boss telling us or an existing code base that we're having to maintain or whatever language or colleagues some people to read our code right yes and neither of us are part of a team that would think we had lost our minds but i also there are very good modern languages that are not that list either i think it really comes down to more trends but also what your business is demanding of you yes i mean that's i mean for we already know for decades coders resumes have listed all the languages that they can you know that they're proficient in right so any coders should be able to write in any language if they're any good right or be able to pick up a new one yeah that's what i mean you can yes yeah all the concepts are the same and that's where a chatbot can help you it's like okay that's right you know i'm not proficient in pearl but i need to solve a pearl problem so you know what what what rejects you what would you expect to you i've actually done that and it may not be right but it it's a good start it's a good start i've taken some python code that i didn't fully understand given it's a chatgpt and say what would this look like in lisp and yeah it wasn't perfect but it gave me a big head start on understanding what that code was doing yeah yep so the question is are we going to turn programming over to ai's well eventually i guess well coding appears to be something that ai's may be able to do you know and it makes a sort of sense for code to be something that an ai might do well because after all it's talking to a machine so that begs the question what's going on at the university level with computer science education business insider published a piece last monday titled with ai writing so much code should you still study computer science and the subheading was this new data point provides an answer and now i realize that many of our listeners are well past university age but many will have children or perhaps grandchildren who may be wondering whether coding has been lost to ai so the author of this piece writes one of the most persistent concerns around generative ai is whether the technology will put workers out of a job this idea is particularly caught on in the context of software coding github copilot can write a lot of code these days so is it even worth studying computer science now that's been a question on the minds of math mind at high schoolers since chatgbt burst onto the scene in 2022 there's a new data point that helps answer at least part of this question students are still lining up in droves to take computer science in college let's take the university of california berkeley as an example as this college is at or near the top for computer science as it was when i was there in 73 first year applications to uc berkeley's college of computing data science and society cdss that's not the college i was in i was in wecs electrical engineering computer science but we have cdss the college of computing data science and society anyway first year applications increased 48 percent this year there were 14302 nontransfer applications for this for these cdss majors in the fall of 2024 in coming class versus 9649 the previous year so in one year 48 increase they said for where as for context the number of first year applications to uc berkeley as a whole did not change much from a year earlier so specifically the college of computing data science and society this was announced last week by professor jennifer chays the dean of berkeley's college of cdss during the joint california summit on gen ai in san francisco afterwards business insider got in touch with an interesting guy jon denero a college i'm sorry a computer science teaching professor at uc berkeley to talk about this some more now he's also chief scientist at lilt a generative ai startup and he was previously a researcher at google working on google translate one of the first successful ai powered consumer apps okay so at this point in the article quotes this john denero guy and remember he's a teaching professor of computer science at uc berkeley who's been working with ai at google and has now the chief scientist at a generative ai startup so the article continues in an email to business insider john wrote students quote so this is john speaking students express some concern that generative ai will affect the software engineering job market especially for entrylevel positions but they're still excited about careers in computing i tell them that i think many of the challenging aspects of software development cannot be performed reliably by generative ai at this point and that i expect there will still be a central role for human software developers long into the future so this is a compsai professor teaching professor at merkley who's also deeply steeped in ai technology the article says denaro explained that generative ai is currently very good at replicating parts of software programs that have been written many times before but what if you want to create something new this is where smart human coders will still be needed this makes logical sense as ai models are trained on data if that information doesn't exist yet or it's not part of the training data set the models often get in trouble or as we say they just make it up the narrow said quote generative ai requires a lot of thoughtful human intervention to produce something new and all consequential software development projects involve quite a bit of novelty that's the hard and interesting part of computing that currently requires clever and welltrained people generative ai can speed up the more mundane parts of software development and software developers tend to adopt efficiency tools quickly unquote so this applies to what's happening at lilt which is building an ai platform for translators google translate first came out 18 years ago they write and human linguists still have jobs and are relied upon when translations are really important for instance you could use google translate to read a japanese traintime table but would you use the app to translate your business's most important contract without having a human expert check it out probably not john said quote to reliably produce publication quality translations human expert linguists are still at the center of the process but by using lilts taskspecific generative ai models those experts are much faster more accurate and more consistent as a result more text gets translated at higher quality into more languages unquote and they finish he expects the same pattern to play out in software development a small team of highly trained human developers will have an even greater capacity to build useful high quality software d'naro finished by adding and so future berkeley graduates will have plenty many of opportunities to use their computing skills to improve the world hopefully some more of them will come to work at lilt and i gotta kick out of that because where better to recruit people for your own startup your classes than being yes then teaching them and calling from the herd those that you you want to have working for you and leo it really does make sense you know i'm weird right i mean we already know i code an assembly language at the moment i am creating the scaffolding to access com api objects in my email server from assembly language oh that sounds painful see it is unbelievably painful there would be absolutely libraries galore to do that in any higher level language and there are none no one as far as i know not been done in a sembler yeah but i like it and i also spend a lot of you like it yes i like it and how many times have i written a super fast sort algorithm of one type or another i've written them and i've rewritten them because i like it it's like somebody who loves like a woodworker building chairs it's like i'm gonna make the next chair i build is gonna be better than the last one but you know i'm coding because i want to not because i have to so it totally makes sense to me that that generative ai could be producing a bunch of the crap code that is has that people have already written not the new stuff which is where the fun really is for most people who you know don't like building chairs yes you can always buy a chair but there's a satisfaction and building your own absolutely yeah yeah and i would imagine anybody who's in a computer science program i would hope is is there because they enjoy it because they like it they're not just there to get a job skill i mean that's a that's a nice side benefit it certainly is nice to be able to spend your life doing something to something you'll love you'll be glad okay so uh and this would affect you leo as a linux person in case any of our linux users notice and worry about a sudden torrent of cves emanating from the linux kernel project i wanted to assure everyone that the problem is with the underlying issuing policies and is not reflective of any sudden collapse of the linux kernel code quality catalan simpanu the editor of the risky business newsletter did some editorializing but he drew the facts underlining his recent editorial from across the industry so this is strongly based in what everybody who's looking at this going what the hell is going on is talking about so i'm explaining this beforehand since i wanted everyone to understand that this is you know not just one grumpy guy's opinion here's what he wrote last wednesday he said in february of this year uh get this the linux kernel project was made an official cve numbering authority that's called a cna a cve numbering authority exclusive rights to issue cve identifiers for the linux kernel while initially this looked like good news he wrote almost three months later this has turned into a complete and utter disaster over the past months the linux kernel team has issued thousands of of cve identifiers with the vast majority being for trivial bug fixes and not just security flaws in may alone according to cisco's jeffrey gamlin sorry jerry gamlin the linux team issued over 1100 cves a number that easily beat out professional bug bounty programs and platforms run by the likes of trend micros zero day initiative word fence and patch stack ironically he says this was a disaster waiting to happen with the linux team laying out some weird rules for issuing cves right from the moment it received its cna status we say weird because they're quite unique among all cnas the linux kernel team argues that because of the deep layer where the kernel runs bugs are hard to understand and there's always a possibility of them becoming a security issue later down the line he said direct quote below so this is the next kernel team note due to the layer at which the linux kernel is in a system almost any bug might be exploitable to compromise the security of the kernel but the possibility of exploitation is often not evident when the bug is fixed because of this the cve assignment team is overly cautious and assigned cve numbers to any bug fix that they identify this explains the seemingly large number of cves that are issued by the linux kernel team wow he says while this looks good on paper the reality is that other projects also manage similarly sensitive projects but they don't issue cves for literally every possible bug fix you don't see intel and amd issuing hundreds of cves with each firmware update these projects vet reports to confirm that bugs pose a security risk before or issuing a cve and triggering responses with their customers such as inventory asset scans and emergency patch deployments in other words cves have actual real world consequences they're not just to be used casually he says instead the linux kernel team appears to have adopted a simpler approach where it puts a cve on everything and lets the software and info security community at large confirm whether or not an issue is an authentic security flaw if it's not it's then up to the security and vulnerability management firms to file cve revecation requests with the linux kernel team that's responsible for the affected component linux is new cna rules also prohibit the issuance of cve for bugs in eol linux kernels it's turning me into a hollow all shit i'm sorry for cv for bugs it eol linux kernels which is also another weird take on security he said just because you don't maintain the code anymore doesn't mean attackers won't exploit it and that people wouldn't want to track it linux team will also refuse to assign cves it looks until a patch has been deployed meaning there will be no cves for zero days or vulnerabilities that may require a longer reporting and patching timeline i think they do not know what cve means leo that's nuts i mean it's like if we don't admit that there's a problem then google can't start a clock forcing us to fix it yeah so we're not going to issue it for a zero day or vulnerabilities that may take a while to fix wow i mean you're right it's like they don't at all understand that what cves are for catalyn said the new rules also create a confusing process of validating contesting and rejecting cves i'm not going to go into all of that he said since the venerable brian martin did a way better job back in february open source securities bradley spangler shared a real world example last week of why the entire process of analyzing validating and revoking linux cves is now a giant cluster f you know what of confusion and frustration catalyn said we quote him quote to say this is a complete disaster is an understatement this is why cve should be for vulnerabilities should involve actual analysis and should provide that information in the cve description as any other responsible cna would be doing i'm quote cadlan said linux maintainer greg crow hartman tried to justify the team's approach to its new cve rules but as expected this is not gone down well with those in the infosec community criticism has been levied against the linux kernel team from everywhere and there have some calls for the linux team to reconsider their approach to issuing cves the new rules were criticized right from the getgo the likes of katie mousaurus valentina palmiati ian coldwater bradley spangler again and again adam shaw um tiberius the gr security team the graphino s team and a whole bunch more for saw the disaster that is currently unfolding and if this isn't bad enough the linux kernel team appears to be backfilling cvs for fixes to last year's code generating even more noise for people who use cvs for legitimate purposes some describe the linux team's approach as malicious compliance after the project was criticized for years for downplaying vulnerability reports and contesting cves assigned to its code by other cnas this may not be the case as the new approach has some fans who see its merits such as forcing more people to upgrade their kernels on a more regular basis meaning even if it's not necessary quote the linnick cna this is quoting somebody he doesn't say who the linnick cna intentionally adopts an overly cautious approach and assigns a new cve when in doubt all this may surprise many it is a perfectly legitimate and entirely honest strategy in contrast vendors of proprietary software often tend to take the opposite approach minimizing the assignment of cves whenever possible effectively managing the substantial number of cves involves understanding your kernel configuration having a clear threat model and ensuring the ability to update the kernel as needed i hope that other large projects will eventually adopt linux's approach unquote and cattle and finishes unfortunately all of this cve spam could not have happened at a worse time just as the linux kernel team was getting its cna status nist you know nist was slowing down its management of the nvd database where all cves are compiled and enriched nist cited a staff shortage and a sudden rise in the number of reported vulnerabilities mainly from the iot space having one of every fifth cve being a linux nonsecurity bug is not helping nist at all right now so unfortunately we depend upon cve's to convey true problems that require remediation of some kind having the linux kernel project spewing cves for nonvonability bugs really is an abuse of the system yeah and they're creating a lot of noise which is obscuring the real security issue exactly yeah exactly it has a real potential of just causing people let's cry wolf right your good it's useful you could end up blunting the effect yep what is not blunted leo is the power of our sponsors i like your thinking i like where you're going there mr g we'll be back with more of security now and steve gibson and just a bit the email bag is next but first to word from our sponsor one big thank big the world's changed i think if you listen to the show you kind of understand privacy and ai compliance both are here to stay the regulations governing all of this are in constant flux everywhere in the world new regulations emerging daily organizations are forced to embrace concepts like privacy by design transparency purpose limitation data minimization data subject rights this is all well and good these are good things but most midsized high growth organizations just don't have the time they need to focus on their job on their core offerings they need to have the time and the volume of work to keep a fulltime privacy and aid item busy and even if they could it's really hard to track the top talent your competing gets microsoft and facebook and google that's where one big thing comes in with one big things services it's the number one big thing at onebigthinkcom with one big thing services you're guided by an experienced executive who becomes your data protection officer he's got all the capacity and all the capabilities of a true dpo that's an enterprise security leadership role responsible for overseeing data protection strategy compliance and implementation to make sure that your company's compliant with gdpr ccpa cpra and so forth the role of the dpo includes expert knowledge of data protection law you're gonna see why it's so hard to find this person by the way you've got to know expert knowledge of data protection laws and practices you've got to have broad and deep information privacy compliance and data processing skills sets across industries a complete understanding of it infrastructures technologies technical and organizational structures all in the industry your industry and of course you've got to have excellent management skills as well as the ability to interface easily within turnle staff at all levels i've just written the perfect job listing for your dpo oh let's throw in some ai expertise as well right well guess what that's what one big thing will do for you that you don't have to hire that person you've got one big thing one big thing's ai compliance services designed to integrate with your organization's privacy program and provide the required governance compliance and assessment activities under all these new regulations they'll even help you train your team raise awareness and train staff on ai regulatory requirements and issues this is a role you need to fill this is a role that's hard to fill until you go to onebigthinkcom to learn more about how to give your organization sustainable privacy and ai compliance it's not optional anymore let's face it you've got to go to onebigthinkcom that's the number one bigthink onebigthinkcom they're there ready and willing to help you so you could focus on your core mission and not have to worry about regulatory compliance one big thing dot com some ideas time has come now back to mr jibsen ha ha ha stive jibsen yes so grc's email system continues to mature and i could not be more pleased with my decision to create a more convenient means for our listeners to send podcasts feedback some listeners have noted that nowhere on grc's website do i prominently display the email address security now at grccom that's true and that's also deliberate it's clearly not a secret since leo and i will be mentioning it every week here but to whatever degree is possible i'd like to reserve inbound email to that mailbox for podcast feedback there will be a temptation to send things to me that i already pay sue and greg to handle so i'd prefer not to short circuit our traditional lines of communication so once again security now at grccom and i imagine everybody can remember that i did want to let everyone know that after last week's podcast i improved grc's email registration system to also accept email that registered against a user's from header the moment i made that change all false positive rejections stopped we haven't had a single one since then so anyone who may have had initial difficulty registering with private domains fronted by gmail or some other email an automation service should no longer have any trouble and may do so so again i was a little overprotective initially that's fixed it's easier now several people have been worried that they haven't ever received a single piece of email from me they're expecting the flow of weekly podcast announcements so i wanted to assure everyone that so far i have never sent one i'm still working to finish up the front end email registration bounce processing which i expect to complete this week i always wondered about the practice of asking people to enter their email addresses twice i understood that it was to catch typos and when i designed grc's ecommerce system back in 2003 that's what i had it due to but i did that mostly because everyone at the time was doing it now i know why the email registration system i have does not do that and it's somewhat surprising to see how many typos are present in email that cannot be delivered it turns out that dotvom is not a valid toplevel domain and that the v key is right next to the c key the good news is that such typos only result in a brief stumble since this is part of an immediate email confirmation loop so anyone who doesn't receive a confirmation email returns to try again and they will probably enter their email correctly and maybe by typing it more carefully the second time since i think that asking everyone only once because they receive immediate confirmation is more convenient for most people i'm going to leave the system as it is i'm not going to ask everybody to enter it twice the work i'm doing right now is in automating the process of receiving any immediate delivery attempt failures from our email server and holding that information for someone's second attempt when they don't get the first email confirmation and then come back and try again there are a surprising number of mailbox unknown or mailbox over quota bounce backs that i would like to be able to present to someone when they retry using an address that just failed for that reason so once that system is in place i'll actually begin sending email and the system will be up and running okay so i got a kick out of this fictional dialogue with an ai which was titled ordering a pizza in 2024 this was shared by a listener via twitter there's no indication of the dialogue's origin but it's definitely worth sharing so the caller says apparently in another phone is this pizza hut no sir it's google pizza caller oh i must have dialed a wrong number sorry no sir google bot pizza hut last month ha ha ha okay i would like to order a pizza do you want your usual sir my usual you know me according to our caller id data sheet the last 12 times you called you ordered an extra large pizza with three cheeses sausage pepperoni mushrooms and meatballs on a thick crust colors is super that's what i'll have google may i suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta arugula sundried tomatoes and olives on a whole wheat glutenfree thin crust the caller says what i don't want a vegetarian pizza google your cholesterol is not good sir how the hell do you know that well we cross reference to your home phone number with your medical records we have the result of your blood tests for the last seven years uh okay but i do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza i already take medication for my cholesterol excuse me sir but you have not taken your medication regularly according to our database you purchased only a box of 30 cholesterol tablets once at lloyd's pharmacy for months ago of course says i bought more from another pharmacy that doesn't show on your credit card statement i paid in cash but you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement i have other sources of cash that doesn't show on your latest tax returns unless you bought them using an unclared declared income source which of course is against the law colors says what the heck google says i'm sorry sir we use such information only with the soul and tension of helping you the caller says enough already i'm sick of google facebook twitter whatsapp and all the others i'm going to go i'm going to an island without the internet tv where there's no phone service and no one to watch me or spy on me google says i understand sir but you need to renew your passport first it expired six weeks ago so anyway yes if microsoft recall does evolve into a semi smart personal assistant it better not start offering helpful advice or maybe people will think about deleting it or using my force coming freeware app i will see end all recolent i keep trying nathan nathan nathan and nathan i said i'll just make sure you don't have a mouthful of coffee nathan hartley tweeted i would love windows copilot on my work pc though we have far more local admins who have access to everything that i'm comfortable with i will wait a bit for my personal pc now of course nathan is suggesting that an appropriate environment having access to a comprehensive history of everything that has been done on a company machine might be useful but he wonders what access to that information will also be available to local admins and i think that's another very good point all indications are that in their enthusiasm for this idea which is understandable microsoft failed to give sufficient thought to just how transformative a change it would be for a machines entire usage history to be captured and stored in detail we know that enterprise machines are owned and operated by their companies who oversee them in their security so how does recall fit into that environment they're due appear to be some questions still to be answered tom who's tom lawrence tech this was shared via a public tweet so it appeared in my timeline because he referenced at sggrc he said i just had a great conversation with at dr the nerd about adam network pf sense and they don't talk to stranger's system he said i'll be doing some testing but for those who want to learn more right now check out h2dps slash slash adamnetworks and at sggrc episode 946 and he provided a link now of course dr the nerd that would be david rettacop who in my first met when they were an early advertiser on this podcast i think right from the get go leo with the candidate based nerds on site guys at the time and of course as we know david is now part of the team at adam networks and i discussed their work during episode 946 and noted that they have some very interesting and very mature perimeter security technology which definitely worth looking at okay listener john liptack asked steve i've been caught up in google domains in the google domains to square space dns migration and due to square spaces terms of service i want to move however due to the number of security issues with dns as well as your wonderful testing software i've been unable to find the episode where you give your recommendation for a domain name provider can you remind me who you recommend thanks john the name john is trying to recall is hovercom they are my absolute handsdown favorite domain name registrar they were also a twitter sponsor though that followed my switching to them from away from network solutions who was grc's original registrar with whom i registered the grccom domain back in december of 1991 which was a few months after the domain microsoftcom was first registered i could not be more pleased and happy and happy to recommend hover as the place for anyone to hang their domain there i mean again i know that leo you and i both have a ridiculous number of domains just because each one seems inexpensive and maybe we'll use it someday for something i can't even tell you like the nonsense i have no way to what the heck they're all they're all there at hover stephen tampa florida sent me a note regarding the we've talked about a couple of times he said i just want to let you know that after hearing your mention the token of the token two keys on the podcast i ordered two of the t2f2 nfc dual keys i received them today i immediately downloaded the windows app from their website and entered in a pin i then tried them with bitwordon entering them in bitwarden under web often i was able to in other in other words the the the the past keys i was able to log in in every case usba usbc and nfc using either the web app or an android phone of note is that to activate the key you need to squeeze contacts together and not just touch the contacts regards steve and tampa florida so that's welcome feedback and i'm glad they were that those token two keys were not a boom dog they really do look like solid solutions the ones i ordered were back ordered and they've not shown up yet but i'm not in a huge hurry now yesterday a listener bob grant wrote through the new email system with some of the best on the ground feedback about the current state of pasquise support that i've seen so far what bob had to share was of crucial importance because it clearly dispels the belief that all websites which support pasquise support multiple pasquise thereby allowing multiple physical donggles to be used without restriction that's not the case so here's bob's great reporting he said hi steve i've always enjoyed trying out the bleeding edge and i've been using ubekees for over a decade so i recently replaced one of my ubekees with a token 2 key from switzerland to get its 100 past key support i then went about registering multiple ubekees and my new token 2 keys plus bidwarden at multiple sites for instance i have 5 gmail accounts and 2 microsoft accounts i wanted to use with the past keys i discovered a few indications that we have a ways to go before this is ready or easy for prime time for security purposes all the hardware keys require a pin to unlock the key for each login to a site this is as opposed to bitwarden which will do it for you while the vault is unlocked or if locked can use a biometric authentication which is pretty quick further the hardware token operation requires an initial touch to bring up the pin prompt followed by another touch after the pin to perform the authentication token two keys require the phyto recommended six digit pin whereas ub keys allow for a more convenient for digit pin as usual security trumps convenience next i found that a bunch of sites do not follow the phyto recommendations ebay paypal and lowe's only allow a single past key to be registered this of course means you have to use something like bitordin that can sink between devices rather than a single hardware key which is a point of failure kayaq linkedin adobe and amazon do not allow naming the keys as you enroll them linked in calls them pasquille 1 2 3 etc amazon has the date but not the time the key was enrolled so there's no way to differentiate unless you enroll on different days the effect of this is that if you need to revoke a key that has lost you don't know which in rolled key you should be deleted from the site all other sites i used allowed naming at creation and some even allow later renaming of enrolled keys most sites allow quite a few keys but linked in only allows five surprisingly amazon aws seems to only allow fido 1 style u2f mode keys not fido 2 for pasc key login many sites allow keys from one type of device for example ios or ipad os but not from another like firefox on a desktop chrome seems to have better support and i think ms edge has good support although i didn't test extensively chrome allows managing keys you know token 2 or ubakey from its settings security menu within the browser that's so you can list delete edit etc this all suggests that it's still early days but i still kind of prefer my ubaki to my token 2 key and i'm doubtful i'll get to a hundred past keys anytime soon the token 2 is fatter and more bulky and at least feels a little more vulnerable than the ubkee also at one point my t2 stopped responding and prompting for a pin when i tried to log in but i was able to use my ubkee's without a problem once i rebooted my laptop the token 2 key resumed responding i don't know whether the offinfestructure would blacklist a key but i'm going to keep an eye on it now for the record my guess is that the token 2 windows app probably froze somehow that that's what the reboot cured and of course you know usb is always because it came along after windows had already launched and a lot of it been written usb has always been a little bit flaky so anyway he finishes i'd like to see paypal allow multiple keys so i could switch to using a hardware key for added security but i'll need to use bitward and with paypal until then it's disappointing to me that banks investment houses and other high value targets do not currently support pasquise at all in fact most are still using sms text second factors rather than google auth or even the older u2f which could use keys for multiple factor authentication hardware keys can also be used for ssh authentication for more security for your ssh sessions each one takes the same type of slot as a pasquise and can also store the ssh key info which allows it to move the public key from system to system it's easy to see what an uphill battle squirrel faced when even given all the support behind fido 2 its implementation remains spotty and uncertain so wow thank you very much bob that's some terrific feedback about the current state of paschee support all of this does suggest that today's optimal solution driven by the fact that there are sites which will only accept a single pass key enrollment you never know when you're going to hit one would be to enroll one or more where possible hardware dongles only for the highest security sites where that's what you want to then otherwise use a crossplatform password manager such as bitwarden a sponsor of the twitter network and use that hardware dongle to in turn unlock bitwarden if you want more than bitwarden's biometric unlocking in that fashion any site's singlepasskey support won't present a problem since bitwarden is able to present that site single passki from any bit warden supported device and now that it's support for mobile devices is shipping it's on all platforms everywhere elisner using his initials be surprised me he wrote hi steve thank you for the new email system since i don't use any social media regarding code signing hsm's my friend and i are on top of the development of a hobby software used by only 15 to 20 people we used to share the code signing keys between us and one other developer but when i went to renew the code signing certificate i saw there is no longer an option to be able to sign any code without an hsm do you have any idea how we can still have the three developers able to sign to code thank you for all your work longtime listener and a clubtwit member yay thank you okay so this was news to me in a followup note be sent some links so that i didn't need to track them down myself and sure enough reading from the knowledge base maintained by my favorite certificate authority digisert under the title new private key storage requirement for code signing certificates they write starting on june 1 2023 industry standards will require private keys for standard code signing certificates to be stored on hardware certified as fips 140 level 2 common criteria eal4 plus or equivalent in other words an hsm some sort of a hardware dongle this change they write strengthens private key protection for code signing certificates and allows and aligns it with ev extended validation code signing certificate private key protection wow this is actually troubling first as i previously reported the enhanced trust that microsoft was originally conveying to any code signed with a significantly more expensive evsurts which have always required storage in an hsm has been revoked so that there is no longer any benefit to having an ev certificate for code signing no one cares but now the industry has moved to requiring all code signing to be performed inside and by a hardware dongle it was already a problem that any code signing was becoming a requirement which is what we've been seeing due to the increasing prevalence of malicious code the problem is that many open source projects are hobby projects like that of our listener which would otherwise not need to be signed so this general signing requirement was already imposing a burden on developers but now the stakes are raised even higher requiring the purchase of hardware for the storage of any code signing key and as a side effect as our listener notes this also prevents small teams of hobby developers from sharing a single certificate among themselves for the purpose of defraining and advertising its cost across multiple users and it's not as if this is a one time event since search expire and require periodic renewal the hardware won't need renewing but an updated certificate will need to be installed so what i expect will happen is it will start to begin seeing code signing surfers appearing so that multiple members of a team distributed physically geographically will still be able to share a single hsm dongle among themselves and when that happens i sure hope they get their security right since there will be tremendous pressure from malware authors to also get their malicious software signed by those same code signing servers now as we know i wrote such a thing myself as part of spinrite 61's launch since everyone's spinrite download is unique and needs to be individually signed and i commented here a few months ago when we learned that ev search were losing their special treatment that i had apparently wasted my time doing that because my next certificate would not be ev and would therefore not need to be contained within an hsm turns out my time was not wasted after all everyone whose signs code will need to use an hsm to do so as soon as their current nonhsm code signing certificate expired wow yet another tax put on the good guys by malware that's it's unfortunate and again it is there certainly nothing prevents anyone from automating the code signing process as i found due to microsoft's pathetic documentation for doing this for for me it was a heavy lift i got it working it's been surprisingly which is to say utterly bulletproof since i finally finished it and i'm thankful for that but boy i'm sure somebody will do it for linux and open source it and then code signing servers will be something we start to see and for what it's worth be it is possible to rekey a certificate for installation in a second hardware dongle so if you ended up purchasing two dongle's one for each location you could still only purchase one certificate key the process of installing it does not give you any control over it this is by design so that it can only get installed in a single device but it can be immediately rekeed and then are installed into a second device so at least you won't need to be doubling up on purchases if you have two sets of hardware but boy it's very clear this is what the industry has done and it's going to you know it's a tax on open source software and i think it's really unfortunate leo yeah i agree 100 all right i want to talk about codemicrosoftcom i didn't know anything happened to it but you're going to tell us all about it i am but we have one less sponsor break right right yes one we have one more let's take it now yes i'm dice it one last yes i met i kind of met one left one left one left what one left yes and a good one we'll deal with that and then old baby wait to you here what happened i am very interested the first is portion of the show brought to you by collide i've talked about collide with you before you know that is the company that puts users first that gets users to be part of your security team collide works with companies that use octa for our user authentication it adds that extra step the hardware and software authentication make sure that your known users are entering with known secure devices and maybe you heard me tell you that collide was purchased by one password kind of a you know a happy surprise it's big news both companies really focus on leading the industry and creating security solutions that put users first in areas passwords versus authentication but you know that's kind of related aren't they for over a year collide device trust is help companies with octane sure that only known and secured devices can access their data they're still doing that they're just doing it with one password it's actually a match made in a real synergy if you've got octane and you've been thinking ah i really don't know check out collide and you water this is the best time possible there's no better time and by the way very easy to get up and running with collider if heard people say oh is this going to be complicated no collide comes that they complete library of prebuilt device posture checks all the stuff you know you want you know operating system up to date browsers up to date that kind of thing and then it's very easy to write your own custom checks for stuff that's specific to your situation pretty much anything you can think of and here's a nice feature you can use collider devices without mdm which means your entire linux fleet it means contractor devices and every single one of those byod devices the phones and the laptops and your company now the collide is part of one password it's just gonna get better so just to reassure you this is great news check it out at collidecom slash security now to learn more and watch the demo today that's kolidecom slash security now all right what happened to code the microsoftcom so the page i ran across at microsoft and i don't recall how it came to my attention has the intriguing title examining the deception infrastructure in place behind codemicrosoftcom okay what the deception infrastructure what well it turns out that the reader is not left to wonder long since this piece starts out quote the domain name codemicrosoftcom has an interesting story behind it today it's not linked to anything but that wasn't always true and as a matter of fact yesterday i did an ns look up and the domain and there's no name resolution so they completely disconnected it he writes this is the story of one of my most successful honeypot instances and how it enabled microsoft to collect varied threat intelligence against a broad range of actor groups targeting microsoft i'm writing this now as we've decided to retire this capability okay now that's not the good part this astonishing part is how this got started so here's what he wrote codemicrosoftcom was an early domain used to host visual studio code and some helpful documentation the domain was active until around 2021 when this documentation was moved to a new home after the move the site behind the domain was an azure app service site that performed redirection thus preventing existing links from being broken then sometime around mid2021 the existing azure app service instance was shut down leaving codemicrosoftcom pointing to a service that no longer existed this created a vulnerability this situation is what's called a dangling subdomain which refers to as far as i know microsoft just made up never heard that before a dangling subdomain which refers to a subdomain that once pointed to a valid resource but now hangs in limbo again never limbo's not a term that's something you normally do where you have to just like lean over backwards and get underneath of horizontal bar i don't know limbo okay so he says imagine a subdomain like blogsubdomaincom that's used to handle a blog application when the underlying service is deleted the blog engine you might update your page link and assume the service has been retired however there is still a subdomain pointing to the blog what this is now dangling and cannot be resolved okay he says a malicious actor can discover the dangling subdomain except no it's a subdomain of your own domain so a malicious actor what do you mean they can discover it anyways it says i'm malicious this is what he said a malicious actor can discover the dangling subdomain provision a cloud azure resource with the same name and now visiting blogsumdomaincom will redirect to the attacker's resource what he says now they control the content he says this happened in 2021 when the domain was temporarily used to host a malware command and control service thanks to multiple reports from our great community this was quickly spotted and taken down before it could be used as a response to this microsoft now has more robust tools in place to catch similar threats okay so first of all let me just say holy crap and i hope that that no one listening to this while driving just lost control of their vehicle because this is nothing short of insane that that could happen i'm not trained up on azure and on how or why it might be possible for a so called dangling subdomain of microsoftcom to be casually commandeered by someone not microsoft by giving their own azure cloud instance the same name as an unassigned microsoft subdomain all i can surmise is that there must be some serious architectural design problems over in microsoft land for that to ever have been possible that's just nuts but in any event this author continues by posting the rhetorical question how did it become a honeypot he says today it's relatively routine for mstic to take control of an attackercontrolled resource and repurpose these for threat intelligence collection right like you know they'll take over some domain that was an existing command and control server and run it in order to you know gain intelligence he wrote taking control of a malware command and control environment for example enables us to potentially discover new infected nodes right in other words because the infected machines will be falling home to the mothership for instructions so he says at the time of the dangling code go codemicrosoftcom subdomain he says this process was relatively new we wanted a good test case to show the value of taking over resources versus taking them down so instead of removing the dangling subdomain we pointed it instead to a node in our existing vast honeypot sensor network he says and just for anyone who doesn't know but everyone does a honeypot is a decoy system designed to attract a monitor malicious activity honeypot's can be used to collect information about the attackers their tools their techniques and their intentions honeypots can also be used to divert the attackers from the real targets to consume and waste their time and resources microsoft's honeypots sensor network has been in development since 2018 it's used to collect information on emerging threats to both our and our customers' environments the data we collect helps us be better informed when a new vulnerability is disclosed and gives us retrospective information on how when and where exploits are developed this data becomes enriched with other tools microsoft has available turning it from a source of raw threat data into threat intelligence this is then incorporated into a variety of our security products customers can also get access to this via sentinels emerging threat feed the honey pot itself is a custom design framework written in csharp it enables security researchers to quickly deploy anything from a single http exploit handler in one or two lines of code all the way up to complex protocols like ssh and vnc for even more complex protocols we can hand off incoming connections to real systems when we detect exploit traffic and revert these shortly after it is our mission to deny threat actors access to resources or enable them to use our infrastructure to create further victims that's why in almost all scenarios the attacker is playing in a high interaction simulated environment no code is run everything is a trick or deception designed to get them to reveal their intentions substantial engineering has gone into our simulation framework today get this over 300 pseudo vulnerabilities can be triggered through the same exploit proof of concepts available in places like github and exploit db thread actors can communicate with over 30 different protocols and can even log in and deploy scripts and execute payloads that look like they're operating on a real system there is no real system and almost everything is being simulated okay so wow let me just say props where it's due and it's definitely due here that is some seriously cool technology they've created the matrix a simulated deliberately vulnerable environment that's designed to lure bad guys into believing that they've successfully exploited any of more than 300 known vulnerabilities on a machine while retaining the control that the actual exploitation of the vulnerability was designed to bypass so it looks like a duck and it cracks like a duck but it ain't no duck very very cool tech so he continues it's impossible that in standing up a honeypot on an important domain like microsoftcom it wasn't possible for attackers to use this as an environment to perform other web attacks that might rely on same origin trust meaning they had to make sure that a bad guy could not originate their attacks from inside microsoftcom because that's where codemicrosoftcom was you can imagine that everybody knows what microsoftcom networks are and it would not not be a stretch to imagine that there are some enterprises that have white listed microsoft networks after having to put lots of individual white list ips some guys just said oh forget it let's just white list the whole you know slash 16 or whatever microsoft has so we said so again origin of trust they could not allow the origin to be microsoftcom so we said demiticate this further we added the sandbox policy to the pages which prevents these kinds of attacks so he writes what have we learned from mahani pah our sensor network has contributed to many successes over the years we've presented these at computer security conferences in the past as well as shared our data with academia and the community we incorporate this data into our security products to enable them to be aware of the latest threats in recent years this capability has been crucial to understanding the zero day and endday ecosystem during the log for shell incident we were able to use our sensor network to track each iteration of the underlying vulnerability and associated proof of concept all the way back to github this helped us understand the groups involved in productionizing the exploit and where it was being targeted our data enables internal teams to be much better prepared to remediate and provides the analysis for detection authors to improve products like microsoft defender for endpoint in real time that's mde the team developing this capability also works closely with the msrc who track our own security issues when the exchange proxy logon vulnerability was announced we had already written a full exploit handler in our environment to track and understand not just the exploit but the groups deploying it this kind of situational awareness enables us to give clearer advice to the industry better protect our customers and integrate new threats we are seeing into windows and defender windows defender and mde the domain codemicrosoftcom was often critical to the success of this as well as a useful early warning system when new vulnerabilities have been announced threat actors can often be too consumed with trying to use the vulnerability as quickly as possible than checking for deception infrastructure like a honeypot as a result codemicrosoftcom often saw exploits first many of these exploits were attributed to thread actors and stic already tracks okay so it is very interesting that the announcement of a new vulnerability immediately triggers a mass frenzy but we've talked about this effect before right as attackers who are literally everywhere screwing to take advantage of it before machines are patched okay so the author continues what happened next he says the code subdomain had been known to bug bounty researchers for several years so whenever they would receive a report from someone who believed that they had discovered a critical vulnerability for this domain these would be closed to let them know they had found a honeypot we've asked these security professionals to refrain from publishing details of this service in an effort to protect the value we received from it we've also understood for a while that this subdomain would eventually need to be retired once its existence had become too well known to be a value that time finally arrived on april 25th a sudden uptick in traffic to the subdomain and posts on twitter revealed that the domain was being investigated by broad groups of individuals since this discovery meant that the secret was out and the subdomain had lost its value we decided to fully reveal the truth and retire the system i have a chart in the show notes that shows this where they're basically ticking along it almost nothing and then over the course of a couple days the traffic just explodes he said the timeline gives an order of events from our perspective it's unknown exactly how the full exploit url of our server and that up in google search database but it looks like this and they associated discovery on twitter slash x culminated in almost 80000 80000 we chat exploits in a threehour period it's unlikely that google crawler would have naturally found the url our current theory is that a security researcher found this and submitted a report to microsoft as part of this process either the chrome browser or another app found this url and submitted it for indexing okay so in other words it's very difficult to keep anything a secret on the internet it's easy to imagine that google would have set up chrome to feed urls back to them for bot crawling indexing that way users of chrome are unwittingly providing google with links to index as it means for assuring that google bots are able to discover everything even things that are not pointed to by anybody else as in this case in this case they somehow discovered a secret that microsoft had been trying to keep quiet for several years the timeline showed that in march the wechat exploit appeared in google search results for the first time april 15th a redacted screenshot of an exploit mitigation was posted online and some debate followed as to whether the domain was for the decodemicrosoftcom subdomain six days later on the 21st of april google trends show that many people were now searching for the code domains three days after that on the 24th they start noticing a significant uptake in traffic to the subdomain and finally on the 26th they are hit with a 126000 times more requests than average they write by the 26th of april we were handling 160000 requests per day up from the usual between five and one hundred most of these requests were to a single endpoint handling a vulnerability in the wechat broadcast plugin for wordpress that cve201816283 this enabled anyone to run a command from a parameter in the url looking at these urls we found 11000 different commands being attempted most of these pushed a message by some group or another stating that the site had been hacked by them so just ego this was a simulation so nothing happened removing these messages gave a clearer picture of the kinds of commands people were entering most commands entered were linux recon commands these attempted to find out what the system was what files it contained and more broadly what value it was to microsoft the next biggest group were running command these ranged from basics linux commands like who am i but a few enterprising folks went on to run scripts of various languages most people who interacted didn't get further than the wii chat exploit over the three busiest days 63 different exploits in total were triggered the biggest surprise was that most researchers stuck to http only three groups probed the other ports and even fewer locked into the many other services that were available some of the best investigation came from a twitter handle at simply lurking 2 on twitter slash x who after discovering that the system was a honeypot continued to analyze what we had in place and constructed first constructing a rick roll and then a url that when visited would display a message to rightclick and save a payload with so much information now publicly available the value of this subdomain was diminished on april 26th we replaced the site with a 404 message and are working on retiring the subdomain completely however our ongoing data collection efforts are undeminished microsoft runs many of these collection services across multiple data centers our concept has been proven and we have rolled out similar capabilities at higher scales as many other nations or locations worldwide this continues to give us a detailed picture of emerging threats so that's the story of the rise and fall of a hunting pot which microsoft inadvertently created but then managed to put to great use and advantage for several good years before its identity finally leaked was made public thus rendering it useless we've also seen how the tip of the iceberg for a honeypot is that it can detect that something is wrong on a network that's generally sufficient for most purposes but this but as we see this can also be taken far beyond simple detection with a sufficiently advanced vulnerability simulator to reveal exactly what bad guys will do when they're given more rope to hang themselves wow i used to go to codemarkersoftcom all the time to download vs code i had no idea that they had abandoned it that is a wild story wow yeah and leo again the idea that not having something responding to codemicrosoftcom which used to be hosted by azure allowed somebody else to register that again it's amazing i hope that there's somebody's looking at this architecture because something is broken if that's possible you shouldn't be able to go to a create a subdomain if the domain is owned by somebody else that doesn't make any sense i know i know it's in a safe is it still that way i mean should i worry about twitter tv people getting subdomains on our own are you on azure no that's not who i'm not what are we no one's ever heard of this this is just nuts it's crazy the only thing that's so so codemicrosoftcom must have pointed to an ip in azure right and something is rotten and done marsh i've got another against denmark but like there that's wow she'd be blaming the register i mean isn't that or the dns resolver isn't that no no it's somebody somehow created their own azure instance and because it was named codemicrosoftcom it's all in the name somehow it glued itself to that subdomain which they called dangling a dangling subdomain no it was never heard of a dangling subdomain subdomains don't dangling they made that up what a story well at least they got some good out of it right i think that's yeah it did they turned it around the fact that it was in microsoft and they had some some seriously cool tech i mean again what i think must be the case as i was reading this to our listeners i was thinking why don't we get the sense in general that microsoft is this good i mean they were really they are there are parts of microsoft that are really good mark people they're just so they're buried so deeply down in in the infrastructure that you know you just talk to morons on the surface while i don't even think it's that i think it's just so complex the things fault through the cracks so david reddock so leo just go to answersmicrosoftcom and you will swim in moron the most moronic nonsense you have ever seen the intern did it god the intern's vault david renekop who's we were just talking about is in our discord i guess you're a club member thank you david he said as your is the authoritative dns for an azure tenant and there's your problem right there right they've decided we don't need to think dna service well we'll do it we'll resolve the domain we can do that steve you've always been full of fascinating stuff today it was no exception another great
