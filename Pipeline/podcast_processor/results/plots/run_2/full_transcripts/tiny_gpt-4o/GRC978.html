     It's time for security now Steve Gibson is here. He has a rebuttal to Microsoft's  rebuttal to last week's accusation all about Microsoft recall. He still says it might  want to hold off on that one. Apple gets a password manager. Is it good enough for government  work? I will also talk about the use of AI encoding is AI going to kill the future of code.  And what Microsoft did when they had a little error that's ended up becoming a very useful tool to go after bad guys.  So coming up next, I'm security now.  Podcasts you love.  From people you trust.  This is Twitter.  This is security now with Steve Gibson.  episode 978 recorded Tuesday, June 11th, 2024. The rise and fall of code that Microsoft's  dot com. It's time for security now to show you weight all week for as Steve says.  It's Tuesday. It must be Steve Gibson. Hello, Steve. Hello, Leo. We're out walking with some friends  around the neighborhood yesterday. And I, I, I, there's like three long legs of our community.  And after doing two of them, they, we all started down the third. And I said, well, no,  it's podcast night. I got to get back to work it on the podcast. So I got the walk was cut short.  And, uh, Laurie had been pushing me to start earlier on Mondays, because I was, I would be trying  to get worked on in through the mornings, but invariably it would creep into the afternoon  and then I'd be like, oh shoot, I should have been, I should be further along.  So now I'm just not even trying to get anything done on Monday, except work on the podcast.  Now, that's the, that's the, the driving force.  We were seeing the result of that today because we have 24 pages of show notes.  As it consequence of me having gotten the next or early start yesterday,  Now, normally the people who listen to us at 1.5x do so because I kind of plot along.  There'll be no plotting today because we have a lot of ground to cover.  So if you are hearing me at 1.5x and wondering why I seem to be going a little faster  than usual, you might want to consider dropping down to 1x and hearing it at normal speed.  We got a bunch of things to talk about on today's podcast, 978 for Patch Tuesday.  I am mourning the fact, and if one of our listeners is listening, someone tweeted me a couple  weeks ago, this picture of a pipe that had just had patches all over it like crazy and  silver like screw on straps and it looked like this thing was on life support. I thought that  is the most perfect picture of the week for Microsoft patch Tuesday, but I don't know what happened  of the picture. So maybe if the person is listing, you can send it to me again, because  and I'll hold it for July's patch Tuesday, we're going to talk about something really interesting,  which is I titled this the rise and fall of code dot microsoft dot com, which everyone would  recognize as a subdomain, the code subdomain of Microsoft.com.  What they essentially the way what happened started was with an architectural failure,  the scope of which I can hardly grasp. I have no idea what's going on up there in  that what I will describe could have happened, but it did, but they turned it around.  I mean, they still have some problems to solve, but they managed to repurpose this mistake  into something that ended up creating a ton of intelligence for them, collecting a ton of  intelligence.  Anyway, we're going to have a lot of fun with that.  The first we're going to talk about how Microsoft has responded to the title wave of  criticism that they've received over recall and what about Google, who else recently lost  control of their data?  Apple devices will be getting a password manager.  What?  What about I Cloud?  I thought we already had that.  Is that a drone recording a wedding or is it the Chinese Communist Party surveillance  device?  What did Slash date as survey of more than 10,000 coders around the world reveal about their use of AI today and their choice of language?  And if AI's concoed, which they see mayble to do, then what's the career future for programmers?  We have some feedback on that.  Also, why has the Linux project, the Linux kernel project suddenly begun spewing CVEs in  great number?  Will we be able to order pizza in the future, or should we just give up now, or maybe order  all your pizza today and freeze it?  What did one listener discover when he attempted to register his new PASC key devices  across the internet?  as I said, how did a stunning mistake at Microsoft turn into a gold mine of attacker intelligence?  So, not a slow podcast today for the second podcast of June.  We know Microsoft never makes any mistakes.  Oh, the way to hear this one.  Oh, I just when I read this, I thought, and this is from them.  This is their own blog posting somebody confessed this, which I first bought though  but like  Really?  Well, I know I will get there. We'll get there. It's stunning. I know we got 26 pages  So let me hurry up here and tell you about our first sponsor of the show today <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Wonderful company.

picture of the week, Steve.  So we've had endless fun with these bizarre pictures  of like, if gate blocking a path where there's open grass  on either sides of it.  It's like, what?  What?  What?  You just just, like, what were they thinking?  Anyway, somebody had fun over the micro-sand  soft recall issue and actually relative to their most recent update, this titled,  the This titled Microsoft recall and then it shows us one of the pictures that we've shown  before, a bright yellow gate in the middle of a walkway, but you know, with actually some,  it looks like there actually is footpath traffic on either side because the grass is, you know,  Patted down in a little brown. Anyway, the bottom it says referring to the skate. Don't worry. It's encrypted.  Yeah, right. I'll have well actually right now last Friday. Mary Jo fully. Yes, right. Our  Mary Jo of Windows Weekly fame. She tweeted Microsoft, Bally into growing security centric criticism  is making some tweaks to its coming Windows 11, 24H2 recall app.  The first co-pilot plus PCs are still on track to start shipping June 18th.  Okay, now today is June 11th. So that's one week from today, folks.  And she said, and the tweaks are slated to take effect by then too.  Okay, so she was referring, of course, to a Microsoft Windows blog,  that is when she said Microsoft bowing to security center concerns,  posted by the corporate vice president for Windows plus devices.  So it appears that Windows plus devices are a category,  so that would presumably mean co-pilot plus.  Anyway, this guy posted under the title update on the recall preview feature  for co-pilot plus PCs. And as Mary Jo noted,  This is clearly in response to the security industry's reaction over the previous three weeks  to the privacy implications that would be present. My contention is and I'll be echoing this  a couple other times today in any system that aggregates for all time. Everything a user does on their  PC. Okay, and I'll have a little more to say specifically about that in a moment, but first,  First, let's hear from Microsoft.  Since a lot of the danger, recall represents  as reflected by Microsoft's attitude toward recall.  I want to share this VPs entire post.  It's not very long, but it's important that they're  attitude be seen.  So bear with me at the start, since it's pure Microsoft  marketing speak.  Anyway, everyone will recognize it as such.  He wrote, today we're sharing an update  on the recall feature in preview for co-pilot plus PCs, including more information on the  setup experience, privacy controls, and additional details on our approach to security.  On May 20th, we introduced co-pilot plus PCs, our fastest most intelligent Windows PCs ever.  Copilot Plus PCs have been re-imaged from the inside out to deliver better performance  and all new AI experiences to help you be more productive, creative, and communicate more  effectively.  One of the new experiences exclusive to Copilot Plus PCs, thank God, is recall.  A new way to instantly find something you've previously seen on your PC.  To create an Explorable Visual Timeline, Recall periodically takes a snapshot of what appears  on your screen.  These images are encrypted, stored, and analyzed locally using on-device AI capabilities  to understand loosely termed, right?  They're context.  Okay.  He says, when logged into your Copilot Plus PC, you can easily retrace your steps visually  using Recall.  to find things from apps, websites, images, and documents that you've seen, operating  like your own virtual and completely private photographic memory.  You're always in control of what's saved.  You can disable saving snapshots, pause temporarily, filter applications, and delete your  snapshots at any time.  As AI becomes more prevalent, we're re-architecting windows.  really like there are dialogues from Windows 95 that pop up every so often in  Windows 11. So right, all we've ever seen is some you know, paving over the  previous pavement which was over the pavement before that and so on. So okay,  rearchitecting Windows to give customers and developers more choice to leverage  both the cloud and the power of local processing on the device may possible by the  neural processing unit, the NPU. This distributed computing model offers choice for  both privacy and security. All of this work will continue to be guided by our  secure future initiative SFI. Our team is driven by a relentless desire to  to empower people through the transformative potential of AI,  and we see great utility and recall,  and the problem it can solve.  We also know for people to get the full value  of the experiences like recall,  they have to trust it.  That's why we are launching recall in preview  on Copilot Plus PCs.  To give customers a choice to engage with the feature early,  or not, and to give us an opportunity to learn  from the types of real world scenarios,  customers and the Windows community finds most useful.  Okay, so under the subhead of listening to  an acting on customer feedback, he wrote,  even before making recall available to customers,  we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier  for people to choose to enable recall on their co-pilot plus PC and improve privacy and security  safeguards. With that in mind, we are announcing updates that will go into effect before the  recall preview ships to customers on June 18. So like as Mary Jo said, right now, before next week.  So first he said, we are updating the setup experience of co-pilot plus PCs to give people  a clearer choice to opt in to saving snapshots using recall.  He said, if you don't proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default.  So that's a big change and that matters.  The flip side is how much does it really matter?  You know, we've seen how persistent, seductive and eventually forceful Microsoft can be when  they want to push their users in a certain direction.  It's not that difficult to imagine that while the user might need to switch it on, Microsoft  will not be cautioning the user about the systems inherent dangers.  Rather, they will be promoting the benefits and touting encryption, locality, security,  and all the rest.  I believe the upshot will be that users will turn it on if nothing less just to see  what it's about, because Microsoft will be making it very appealing.  But still, if nothing else having people turn it on, probably gets them off the hook when  things go wrong.  After all, well, we didn't ship it with it on.  You turn it on.  And it's like, yes, because you told me to.  Okay, anyway, second.  Windows Hello enrollment is required to enable recall.  In addition, proof of presence is also required to view your timeline and search and recall.  Okay, so that's these are all good things, right?  They've created additional hurdles, barriers, requirements in order to gain access to this.  And I'll just note through the front door, like gain access the way you're supposed to.  They're not talking about gaining access the way you're not supposed to.  We'll see how that turns out.  And third, he said, we're adding additional layers of data protection,  including just in time decryption protected by windows,  hello, enhanced sign-in security.  So recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible  when the user authenticates.  On the other hand.  Okay, anyway.  Finally, he said, in addition, we encrypted this search index database, which wasn't originally  decrypted.  So finally, he says, secure by design and secure by default.  In line with Microsoft's SFI, that's the secure initiative thing, principles.  Before the preview release of Recall to Customers, we're taking steps to increase data  protection. Copilot plus PCs will launch with just in time decryption protected by windows  hello and hands-sign in security. So recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible  when the user authenticates. This gives an additional layer of protection to recall data in addition  to other default enabled windows security features like smart screen and defender which use advanced  AI techniques to help prevent malware from accessing data like recall.  Now, okay, remember that last week, Kevin Beaumont deliberately used known to Microsoft  Info Stealer malware, which Windows Defender was so slow to recognize that the Info  Stealer had already successfully infiltrated the user's entire recall history before  Defender woke up and shut it down. So we should again the problem is  Microsoft's heart being in the right place  Does it help anybody because windows as we know is  It's not an exaggeration to say riddled with vulnerabilities because you know  More than a hundred are being fixed today in in this in today's windows update. Okay, anyway  He said, we also know the best way to secure information on a PC is to secure the whole PC itself.  Right, because that's been going so well.  And he said, we want to reinforce what has previously been shared from David Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security about how coal pilot plus PCs have been designed to be secure by default and share additional details about our security approach.  In other words, unlike all of our previous Windows systems, which really weren't all that  secure, even though we've all used told you they were, but oh baby, this time we really  and truly mean it, not like all those previous times.  So he said some notable examples of security enhancements include all copilot plus PCs  will be secured, core PCs, bringing, which doesn't matter if the Windows that runs on  it isn't secure, but he said bringing advanced security to both commercial and consumer  devices.  In addition to the layers of protection in Windows 11, secured core PCs provided  advanced firmware safeguards and dynamic root of trust measurement to help protect from  chip to cloud.  And that's a new phrase that Microsoft is using from chip to cloud, which you know from  what, cradle to grave.  That's right.  Also, Microsoft Pluton, security processor will be enabled by default,  or goody, on all co-pilot plus PCs.  Pluton is a chip to cloud security technology, designed by Microsoft and built by silicon  partners with zero trust principles at the core.  This helps protect credentials, identities, personal data, and encryption keys, making  them significantly harder to remove from the device, even if a user is tricked into installing  malware or an attacker has physical possession of a PC. Again, unfortunately, making sure  that a buggy operating system is an altered before it boots or while it's booting doesn't  help you once the buggy operating system is running. But at least it didn't get compromised  before a booted who cares.  Haha.  Anyway, he said, all coal pilot plus PCs will ship with windows, hello, enhanced, hello,  enhanced sight insecurity.  This provides more secure biometric sightings and eliminates the need for a password.  Because yeah, who wants those passwords when you can smile at it?  Okay, under the headline, protecting your privacy on coal pilot plus PCs, we have in  In our early internal testing, we've seen different people use recall in the way that  works best for them.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Let's skip all this because we don't have a lot of time.  And this is just all same stuff.  He's basically saying, okay, we heard you, we're going to turn it off by default.  We're going to seduce people to turn it on.  But if they do, it's their fault not hours because after all, they were the ones who  turned it on and oh baby you know this is the most secure thing we've ever made so again as I said  before we've always we've always told you that remember bomber jumping around on stage about  Windows XP which turned out to be the worst security of any operating system to date that they'd had anyway  So, basically they're saying, we heard you and here are all the reasons why we're going  to keep doing what we were doing, except we're going to turn off by default as I get  out of jail free card.  So anyway, we know that users will be impressed by the sounds of all this security.  And I have no doubt that users are going to want to have the power that this provides.  don't get me wrong. I mean, I, I get it. This is a seductive feature. And that's part  of why this is a double-edged sword. You know, make them, no mistake about it. This is powerful.  But it's because it's powerful that it's also so dangerous and brings the potential for  great harm. Will that harm come to pass? Well, we'll be here to see. I should also note  that I've been asked by a number of our listeners  whether I would consider creating some sort of utility  that absolutely positively guarantees that recall  is not running on a machine.  We'll see how all this goes.  But I am inclined to do so.  And if so, I know what I'll call it, and Leo,  I will make sure you're not sipping coffee  when I reveal its name.  Okay, I put the coffee down. Okay.  Because, yeah, and you'll have to set  yourself over your ball because you're going to love this one.  Anyway, we'll see how it goes. Kevin Beaumont also weighed in on Microsoft's revised explanation.  He posted this on MasterDawn. He said, obviously, I recommend you do not enable recall  and tell your family not to enable it too.  It's still labeled a preview, and I'll believe it is encrypted when I see it.  There are obviously serious governance and security failures at Microsoft  around how this played out that need to be investigated and suggests they are not serious about AI safety.  And I think that raises a really good point.  It's like, you know, they announced this,  and we saw such a jumping up and down,  talking about how great it was gonna be,  and the entire security community had a collective meltdown.  So that tells you something about,  like, why they need to have this in people's machines,  which again, comes back to my theory  about what they're actually planning,  which is that this will be used to train  a some sort of high power local assistant.  And again, I get it.  I mean, that would be so cool.  But they've never demonstrated their ability  to do anything like this safely.  I should mention that Google with their Chrome OS  is also in on the store everything that happens  for possible later use bandwagon. Everyone  can sense that there's huge potential here somewhere,  so no one wants to be left out. Last week, John Solomon  Goules VP in charge of the Kromo S said that they're so  called memory feature. Okay, they may be talked to Apple  about naming things. As that, that's what they're  currently unofficially calling it, is different from  recall. Okay, but that he describes recall. He says,  Because users will have a control of how and where the memory feature works.  Right, just like recall, they'll offer.  So not so different from recall.  And after all, if you turn it off, then you're not going to get it.  So people are not going to turn off. They're going to have it on if they want it.  And then suffer the consequences if there are any.  Anyway, Google apparently already wants to distance itself from the stink surrounding the  announcement of recall.  The New York Times on the topic of is it possible to keep secrets?  Last Friday, 270 gigabytes of data belonging to the New York Times, which I'm quite certain  the New York Times wanted to keep secure and secret,  and which those in charge of securing it  were absolutely impossitively certain  was completely secure until it wasn't.  You know, just like Microsoft is absolutely  and positively certain, they're going to secure  their users' recall data until they don't.  In the case of the New York Times, it got loose.  an unknown threat actor leaked the New York Times source code as in all of it.  All 270 gigabytes of it. After one of the company's IT guys apparently left a private  GitHub access token in a public code paste. The leaked data includes the source code of the company's  entire public website, mobile apps, and even for those who are interested, it's  world-game.  The 270 gigabytes of data being made available on the Dark Web is mostly unincrypted.  The hacker posted, quote, basically all source code belonging to the New York Times  company, 270 gigabytes.  are around 5,000 repos out of them less than 30 are additionally encrypted. I think he said  3.6 million files total uncompressed tar. And I have a picture in the screen in our show notes  of the screen that was posted on the dark web with the series of links so that YouTube can  and download 270 gigabytes and find out what the New York Times  coders have been up to.  The lesson here is that unfortunately, mistakes happen.  In fact, Leo, where are we to rename this podcast?  It would be mistakes that happen.  Yes, that's the whole story right there.  No, yeah, we've seen stories of valuable exposed  credentials sitting unnoticed for years, right?  Where like like some hacker came along and saw that a credential had been  post in publicly, but nobody noticed until now.  One real concern for the future against the background of mistakes happen  is that there may soon be if there aren't already malicious AI driven  bots, scanning and rifling through the internet, looking for any fresh mistakes of  value that anyone may have made.  The point is, our world is changing right underneath us right now, and I'm not sure  the good guys are winning.  It, you know, this whole thing feels somewhat asymmetric, right?  Because I mean, as we know, security is about a series of links, and we keep seeming to  add more links to the chain, any one of which being defective can break the entire strength  of the chain. Again, it feels like an asymmetric fight that we are not clearly getting at this  point. Pretty much losing, I think would be fair. All right, how about this? You can't recall  or recall recall.  Oh no.  No, I mean, I almost have to do the app just so I could use this name.  It is recall what?  Okay, I can't wait, it'll be fun. <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> Let's take a break, Lee.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Okay, security now is brought to you by.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Delete me with everything we talk about on this show.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It seems pretty clear that privacy is important to you.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I'm not blowing smoke when I say that.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> But all you have to do is go out and Google your name,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> search see it in F for your name, and you'll see how little privacy you actually have.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And that's probably because of data brokers.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> The sad thing about data brokers is we still have yet to have a federal law making it illegal,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> which means it's completely legal for companies, including your ISP and for company<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> to do business with, every site you visit, to share your personal data with these data brokers.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And then these data brokers can completely legally sell it on to anybody who has the money,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> including foreign governments, our own government, and attackers, bad guys.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> know this happened, it happened to us.

So, and I know you'll have something to say about this one, Leo,  during yesterday's worldwide developer conference,  or the kickoff, Apple introduced their forthcoming passwords app.  Now, of course, Apple users have long been using their iCloud account  the store and sink their passwords among their devices.  But what was going on?  Wasn't super transparent.  No.  It just worked.  Without a clear and clean UI, it was necessary to dig down  into the control app to locate a sub-page.  So the passwords app that will be included in the next major  release of their OS's.  So that would be iOS 18, Mac OS, Sequoia, and Vision OS 2  will provide a UI for Apple's storage of this information.  Now, since this is not ever going to be a cross-ecosystem solution,  you know, it's Apple only.  Those of us, it's Windows.  Well, yeah, and I heard you say something about how to cloud  for Windows, yes, we're to app.  Anyway, I'll just finish and say that those of us using Windows Linux  or Android will likely remain with whatever cross-ecosystem solution  solution we're using today. But this move does create an explicit and native password manager  for Apple OS's for the first time. And if someone is 100% pure Apple world, it likely offers  everything anyone would need. It also incorporates clear past keys management and a built-in  one time password style authenticator.  Since I'm currently using OTP off as my one time password  authenticator of choice, I'll look at what Apple has to offer  once I upgrade my iPhone to something that will run iOS 18.  I think I'm stuck back on 12 or something right now.  But so Leo, what is the, I hear that you guys using  the word sure locked.  Where did that come from?  So way back in the day.  I mean, I think this is 20 years ago.  There was an app called Sherlock  that let you find files on your device.  It was really good.  You could, you know, you'd make an index  and you'd Sherlock and you could find anything on your hard drive.  Then Apple released something it calls spotlight.  And Sherlock was at a business overnight.  And so ever after, when Apple introduces a product,  the duplicate functionality of a third party product,  and essentially puts him out of business.  we call it being Sherlock and there were all, I mean obviously one password bit  warden and other password managers. There's a Sherlock festival. Yes,  may have been Sherlock by the Spassards, but it was just one of many exactly. Yes.  Now, now we've seen Microsoft do the same thing too, right? Like I was complaining  that it took until service pack three for Windows XP's firewall to be enabled by default.  Back at the time, remember zone alarm was my favorite firewall.  And there was a firewall industry.  Exactly.  Sure.  Windows PC.  Yep.  And then, well, Microsoft says, you know, we're going to put a firewall in,  but don't you worry, it'll be turned off by default.  Well, it eventually got turned on.  And I was just talking to a friend of mine the other day who was asking me if she needed  to be still using macophie.  And I said, oh, Lord, no.  I said, you know, Windows built in Defender is really all  anybody needs.  And I explained that Microsoft does this.  They, they sort of create the capability, but they don't want  to step on anyone's toes.  So they sort of ease it into the world slowly.  Microsoft, I would argue, is a little less caretaking  about that.  They say, yeah, now we're doing that.  So, yeah, anyway.  Yeah, and again, it makes sense for this thing to get moved in.  So there is an, oh, and how I cloud for Windows,  how can you use a password manager for Apple under I cloud for Windows?  Because I mean, it's just, I thought it was just folders.  Oh, no, no, no.  I cloud for Windows, let's you do a lot of things.  And including I guess now access your passwords.  Actually, if that's been around, it is not as elegant as a password manager.  And remember, this is gonna do passkeys, right?  But I don't know, and they didn't really say,  I think the passkeys are hardware dependent,  which means it seems unlikely passkeys  would make it over to Windows.  But they might do what they do now,  which will show you QR code.  And then the phone that you have the passkey on,  you'd right do the QR code.  So, is it gonna be as full featured  as a standalone passerman,  you're probably not. That's often the case. Well, it's thing. And I'm multi-platform. So  you and I will use it. I can't I'm Android and Windows and Linux. Right. But  by the way, a lot of people and you know what I love this because it means a lot of  non-sophisticated users will just do it because it's part of the operating system. It's  people's. Yeah. And I think it it for it. The fact that they're showing it as a  separate thing, you know, helps to raise people's awareness of passwords and the various  aspects of passwords, like past keys and one time passwords and so forth.  You know, it just, you know, it brings it more to light, which has got to be a good thing.  Yeah.  Um, I saw some talk a while back about some congressional pushback on Chinese made  drones by DJI.  You know, when those DJI drones are by far the best drone technology around, in advance  of the US Senate's plan discussion of the so-called countering CCP drones act, which will  limit the use of Chinese made drones in the US on the grounds of national security.  tomorrow, June 12th, DJI will be disabling the ability of users in the US to sink their  drone flight data to its servers. And the option to sink US drone data at all will be  completely removed by the end of the month. So DJI is seeing what's going on with TikTok  and this general sort of concern over what the Chinese Communist Party is doing  with technology that U.S. consumers are excited about.  And so I'm sure they don't want to lose this market.  So they're saying, okay fine, we're going to strip this out of our devices.  So I don't know what a problem that will be for DJI users.  if being able to sync drone flight data to servers is a big deal, but it'll be gone by the end of the month.  Okay, another thing that Leo, I think you're going to get a kick out of seeing,  although you and I are not represented among these statistics, slash data,  revealed some interesting developers' statistics. They recently surveyed 10,000 developers  from more than 135 countries. The question put to them was, quote, how has AI affected your  workflow? Okay, now let me first allow slash dot to introduce themselves. They wrote,  if this is the first time you heard about slash data, if this is the first time you heard  about slash data, I'm happy to share a few quick words rights the person who posted this.  SlashData is a developer research company.  Every quarter, SlashData runs a survey on the developer's global developer audience  to measure the pulse of the developer ecosystem and how they feel about new technologies,  tools, platforms, the support from developer programs and more.  Following the closing of the survey, our expert analysts work to identify key trends  and translate raw data into actionable insights that professionals and companies addressing  a developer audience can utilize to find to in their strategy and address developers needs  and wants. The 26th edition of the developer nation survey reached more than 10,000 respondents  from 135 countries around the world. Slash data announces the first two of the six report series  that are coming widely available to the world, showcasing and dividing into key and diving  into key developer trends for 2024 and beyond. Each report focuses on a specific topic. All reports  published under the slate of the developer nation will be accessible under freshly launched  slash data research space free access for reviewing and downloading. Okay, so the first two chunks  are interesting. The first is how AI has impacted development and the second is the ever-popular  which programming language do you use. So first off AI, they said, how developers interact with  AI technologies has AI taken over the world, not yet, they write. However, it has already achieved  a takeover of all our discussions about the future, indeed it has, and they said 59% of developers  report that they're now using AI tools in their development workflows. This report investigates  the current landscape of developers work with artificial intelligence technologies and how  this impacts their careers. We start by looking at the ways in which developers work with machine  learning models, tools, APIs and services, and highlight the key differences between professional  and amateur developers.  And they go on.  So, on the AI front, we first have four broad categories.  And Lee, I've got a chart at the top of page nine of the show notes.  Four broad categories, 59% report using AI in their own development workflows.  25% are adding AI functions into applications.  And 13% are actively involved in creating AI models.  This leaves only 29% whose development work has not yet been touched by AI in any of those ways.  So, yeah, among the 59% so more than half and fewer than two thirds.  I'm in that.  Still many.  By the way, I have a AI that helps me with my coding.  Yes.  Yes.  So 59% who are now actively using AI tools in their development workflows 42% almost  a half are using chat bots to obtain answers to coding questions.  This is globally out of 10,000 developed more than 10,000 developers surveyed 42% are using  chat bots to obtain answers to coding questions, 27% are using development tools that have AI assistance  built in, and 19 are using generative AI to help generate creative assets.  If coding was a Monday through Friday 9 to 5 job, which I was doing to earn my living,  where I was being judged by my own productivity against my peers, then yeah, I'd be quite happy to get quick answers to questions about how to do this or that from a chatbot AI.  You know, rather than searching around the internet, looking for someone like, uh, uh, uh,  It let like you know wherever on the internet.  Yeah.  Extacus changes the name I just tried to remember.  A stack is change who has who has posted something similar to learn from.  I'd be happy to ask a smart bot.  You know, what it had found from previously doing essentially the same thing.  There's no shame there.  And it's clear that many coders agree.  Okay.  I use it instead of flipping through manuals.  Yes.  Almost universally, this stuff that's on Stack Exchange is useless, but I still have to, I mean,  I don't code enough to remember every, in the language I use as massive commonless. So this isn't  in lieu of looking through manuals, it's very useful. Yep, very useful. Yep. So what's being,  so, so what's going on with the use of programming languages? I have a chart there at the bottom of  page nine, the survey revealed that by far the number one language in use today is JavaScript.  Oh yeah, that's for sure. Yep. Web programming. The current total is estimated to be  25.2 million JavaScript coders. Wow. With that number having grown by 4 million just over the past year.  So 25.2 million JavaScript coders in the number two slot is Python at 18.2 million.  It's probably about a couple of years.  No, but yes, just one language.  So right.  Right.  Python at 18.2 million, which is just a bit ahead of Java at 17.7 million in third place.  Behind those top three is C++ at 11.6, C sharp at 10.2, PHP at a respectable 9.8 million,  visual development tools at 7.2 million followed by plain old C language at 6.5.  Then, instead of decreasing numbers, we have Kotlin, Go, Swift, Rust, Dart, Objective,  See, Ruby, and Lua.  And you know Leo, there's no sign of Lisp or Assembly language on this chart.  What do you suppose that means that neither of the two languages would you and I have chosen to use Lisp  And a simpler, respectively, are in the running here.  We're just smarter than the masses.  That's all there is to it.  You know, I think part of it is that we're able to choose  the language we can most want to code.  Right.  That's right.  We don't have any boss telling us or an existing code base  that we're having to maintain or whatever language.  Or colleagues, some people to read our code.  Right.  Yes.  And neither of us are part of a team that would think we  had lost our minds.  But I also, there are very good modern languages that are not that  list either.  I think it really comes down to more trends, but also what your  business is demanding of you.  Yes, I mean, that's, I mean, for we already know for decades,  coders resumes have listed all the languages that they can, you  know, that they're proficient in.  Right.  So any coders should be able to write in any language if they're  any good.  Right.  or be able to pick up a new one.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  You can, yes, yeah.  All the concepts are the same.  And that's where a chatbot can help you.  It's like, okay, that's right.  You know, I'm not proficient in Pearl,  but I need to solve a Pearl problem.  So, you know, what, what, what rejects you,  what would you expect to you?  I've actually done that.  And it may not be right, but it,  it's a good start.  It's a good start.  I've taken some Python code that I didn't fully understand,  given it's a chatGPT.  and say what would this look like in Lisp?  And yeah, it wasn't perfect,  but it gave me a big head start  on understanding what that code was doing.  Yeah, yep.  So the question is, are we going to turn programming  over to AI's?  Well, eventually, I guess.  Well, coding appears to be something  that AI's may be able to do.  You know, and it makes a sort of sense  for code to be something that an AI might do well.  because after all, it's talking to a machine.  So that begs the question, what's going on  at the university level with computer science education?  Business Insider published a piece last Monday titled  with AI writing so much code,  should you still study computer science?  And the subheading was this new data point  provides an answer.  And now I realize that many of our listeners are well past university age, but many will have children.  Or perhaps grandchildren who may be wondering whether coding has been lost to AI.  So the author of this piece writes,  one of the most persistent concerns around generative AI is whether the technology will put workers out of a job.  This idea is particularly caught on in the context of software coding.  GitHub, co-pilot, can write a lot of code these days.  So is it even worth studying computer science now?  That's been a question on the minds of Math Mind at High Schoolers since chatGBT  burst onto the scene in 2022.  There's a new data point that helps answer at least part of this question.  students are still lining up in droves to take computer science in college.  Let's take the University of California Berkeley as an example.  As this college is at or near the top for computer science, as it was when I was there in  73.  First year applications to UC Berkeley's College of Computing Data Science and Society,  CDSS. That's not the college I was in. I was in WECS, electrical engineering computer science,  but we have CDSS, the college of computing data science and society. Anyway, first year  applications increased 48 percent this year. There were 14,302 non-transfer applications  for this for these CDSS majors in the fall of 2024 in coming class versus  9,649 the previous year.  So in one year 48% increase, they said for where as for context, the number of first  year applications to UC Berkeley as a whole did not change much from a year earlier.  So specifically, the College of Computing Data Science and Society.  This was announced last week by Professor Jennifer Chays,  the Dean of Berkeley's College of CDSS during the Joint California Summit  on Gen. A.I. in San Francisco.  Afterwards, Business Insider got in touch with an interesting guy, Jon DeNero,  a college, I'm sorry, a computer science teaching professor at UC Berkeley to talk about  this some more. Now, he's also chief scientist at LILT, a generative AI startup, and he was  previously a researcher at Google working on Google Translate, one of the first successful  AI powered consumer apps.  Okay, so at this point in the article  quotes this John DeNero guy,  and remember he's a teaching professor of computer science at UC Berkeley  who's been working with AI at Google and has now the chief scientist at a generative AI startup.  So the article continues in an email to business insider John wrote.  Students, quote, so this is John speaking,  students express some concern that  generative AI will affect the software engineering job market,  especially for entry-level positions,  but they're still excited about careers in computing.  I tell them that I think many of the challenging aspects of software  development cannot be performed reliably by generative AI at this point,  and that I expect there will still be a central role for human software developers  long into the future. So this is a compsai professor teaching professor at Merkley,  who's also deeply steeped in AI technology. The article says,  DeNaro explained that generative AI is currently very good at replicating parts of software  programs that have been written many times before. But what if you want to create something new?  This is where smart human coders will still be needed. This makes logical sense as AI models are  trained on data. If that information doesn't exist yet, or it's not part of the training data set,  the models often get in trouble. Or as we say, they just make it up.  The narrow said, quote,  Generative AI requires a lot of thoughtful human intervention  to produce something new,  and all consequential software development projects  involve quite a bit of novelty.  That's the hard and interesting part of computing  that currently requires clever and well-trained people.  Generative AI can speed up the more mundane parts of software development  and software developers tend to adopt efficiency tools quickly, unquote.  So this applies to what's happening at LILT,  which is building an AI platform for translators.  Google Translate first came out 18 years ago, they write,  and human linguists still have jobs,  and are relied upon when translations are really important.  For instance, you could use Google Translate to read a Japanese train-time table,  But would you use the app to translate your business's most important contract without having a human expert check it out?  Probably not. John said, quote, to reliably produce publication quality translations,  human expert linguists are still at the center of the process,  but by using LILTS, task-specific generative AI models, those experts are much faster, more accurate, and more consistent.  as a result, more text gets translated at higher quality into more languages, unquote.  And they finish. He expects the same pattern to play out in software development. A small  team of highly trained human developers will have an even greater capacity to build useful  high quality software. D'Naro finished by adding, and so, future Berkeley graduates will have plenty  Many of opportunities to use their computing skills to improve the world.  Hopefully some more of them will come to work at LILT.  And I gotta kick out of that because where better to recruit people for your own startup  your classes than being yes, then teaching them and calling from the herd those that you  you want to have working for you.  And Leo, it really does make sense.  You know, I'm weird, right?  I mean, we already know I code an assembly language.  At the moment, I am creating the scaffolding  to access com API objects in my email server  from assembly language.  Oh, that sounds painful.  See, it is unbelievably painful.  there would be absolutely libraries galore to do that in any higher level language.  And there are none. No one as far as I know.  Not been done in a sembler. Yeah.  But I like it. And I also spend a lot of you like it.  Yes, I like it. And how many times have I written a super fast  sort algorithm of one type or another.  I've written them and I've rewritten them because I like it.  It's like somebody who loves like a woodworker building chairs.  It's like I'm gonna make the next chair I build  is gonna be better than the last one.  But you know, I'm coding because I want to,  not because I have to.  So it totally makes sense to me  that that generative AI could be producing a bunch of the crap code that is has that people  have already written not the new stuff which is where the fun really is for most people who  you know, don't like building chairs. Yes, you can always buy a chair, but there's a satisfaction  and building your own. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And I would imagine anybody who's in a computer science  program. I would hope is is there because they enjoy it because they like it. They're not just there to get a job skill. I mean, that's a that's a nice side benefit.  It certainly is nice to be able to spend your life doing something to something you'll love you'll be glad.  Okay, so uh and this would affect you Leo as a Linux person. In case any of our Linux users notice and worry about a sudden  Torrent of CVEs emanating from the Linux kernel project.  I wanted to assure everyone that the problem is with the underlying issuing policies  and is not reflective of any sudden collapse of the Linux kernel code quality.  Catalan, Simpanu, the editor of the risky business newsletter, did some editorializing,  but he drew the facts underlining his recent editorial from across the industry.  So this is strongly based in what everybody who's looking at this going, what the hell  is going on is talking about.  So I'm explaining this beforehand since I wanted everyone to understand that this is, you  know, not just one grumpy guy's opinion.  Here's what he wrote last Wednesday.  He said in February of this year, uh, get this.  The Linux kernel project was made an official CVE numbering authority.  That's called a CNA, a CVE numbering authority.  exclusive rights to issue CVE identifiers for the Linux kernel. While initially this  looked like good news he wrote, almost three months later this has turned into a complete  and utter disaster. Over the past months, the Linux kernel team has issued thousands of  of CVE identifiers, with the vast majority being for trivial bug fixes and not just security  flaws.  In May alone, according to Cisco's Jeffrey Gamlin, sorry, Jerry Gamlin, the Linux team  issued over 1100 CVEs, a number that easily beat out professional bug bounty programs and  platforms run by the likes of trend, micros, zero day initiative, word fence, and patch stack.  Ironically, he says, this was a disaster waiting to happen.  With the Linux team laying out some weird rules for issuing CVEs right from the moment  it received its CNA status.  We say weird because they're quite unique among all CNAs.  The Linux kernel team argues that because of the deep layer where the kernel runs, bugs  are hard to understand, and there's always a possibility of them becoming a security issue  later down the line.  He said direct quote below.  So, this is the next kernel team, note, due to the layer at which the Linux kernel is in  a system, almost any bug might be exploitable to compromise the security of the kernel.  But the possibility of exploitation is often not evident when the bug is fixed.  Because of this, the CVE assignment team is overly cautious and assigned CVE numbers to any  bug fix that they identify.  This explains the seemingly large number of CVEs that are issued by the Linux kernel team.  Wow.  He says, while this looks good on paper, the reality is that other projects also manage  similarly sensitive projects, but they don't issue CVEs for literally every possible bug fix.  You don't see Intel and AMD issuing hundreds of CVEs with each firmware update.  These projects vet reports to confirm that bugs pose a security risk before  or issuing a CVE and triggering responses with their customers, such as inventory, asset  scans, and emergency patch deployments.  In other words, CVEs have actual real world consequences.  They're not just to be used casually.  He says instead, the Linux kernel team appears to have adopted a simpler approach where it  puts a CVE on everything, and lets the software and info security community at large confirm  whether or not an issue is an authentic security flaw.  If it's not, it's then up to the security and vulnerability management firms to file CVE  Revecation requests with the Linux kernel team that's responsible for the affected component.  Linux is new CNA rules also prohibit the issuance of CVE for bugs in EOL Linux kernels.  It's turning me into a hollow, all shit.  I'm sorry.  For CV, for bugs, it EOL Linux kernels, which is also another weird take on security.  He said just because you don't maintain the code anymore, doesn't mean attackers won't  exploit it, and that people wouldn't want to track it.  Linux team will also refuse to assign CVEs,  it looks until a patch has been deployed,  meaning there will be no CVEs for zero days,  or vulnerabilities that may require a longer reporting  and patching timeline.  I think they do not know what CVE means.  Leo, that's nuts.  I mean, it's like if we don't admit  that there's a problem, then Google can't start a clock  forcing us to fix it.  Yeah.  So we're not going to issue it for a zero day, or vulnerabilities that may take a while to fix.  Wow.  I mean, you're right.  It's like they don't at all understand that what CVEs are for.  Catalyn said the new rules also create a confusing process of validating,  contesting and rejecting CVEs.  I'm not going to go into all of that," he said,  since the venerable Brian Martin did a way better job back in February.  Open source securities, Bradley Spangler, shared a real world example last week of why the entire  process of analyzing, validating, and revoking, Linux CVEs is now a giant cluster F  you know what? Of confusion and frustration, Catalyn said we quote him, quote,  to say this is a complete disaster is an understatement. This is why CVE should be for  vulnerabilities, should involve actual analysis and should provide that information in  the CVE description, as any other responsible CNA would be doing."  I'm quote.  Cadlan said, Linux maintainer, Greg Crow Hartman, tried to justify the team's approach  to its new CVE rules, but as expected this is not gone down well with those in the Infosec  community.  Criticism has been levied against the Linux kernel team from everywhere, and there have  some calls for the Linux team to reconsider their approach to issuing CVEs.  The new rules were criticized right from the get-go.  The likes of Katie, Mousaurus, Valentina Palmiati, Ian Coldwater, Bradley Spangler, again  And again, Adam Shaw,  um,  Tiberius,  the GR security team,  the graphino S team,  and a whole bunch more  for saw the disaster that is currently unfolding.  And if this isn't bad enough,  the Linux kernel team appears to be backfilling CVs  for fixes to last year's code,  generating even more noise  for people who use CVs for legitimate purposes.  Some describe the Linux team's approach as malicious compliance.  After the project was criticized for years, for downplaying vulnerability reports and  contesting CVEs assigned to its code by other CNAs.  This may not be the case, as the new approach has some fans who see its merits, such as  forcing more people to upgrade their kernels on a more regular basis, meaning even if it's not  necessary.  Quote, the Linnick CNA, this is quoting somebody he doesn't say who, the Linnick CNA intentionally  adopts an overly cautious approach and assigns a new CVE when in doubt.  all this may surprise many, it is a perfectly legitimate and entirely honest strategy.  In contrast, vendors of proprietary software often tend to take the opposite approach, minimizing  the assignment of CVEs whenever possible.  Effectively, managing the substantial number of CVEs involves understanding your kernel configuration,  having a clear threat model and ensuring the ability to update the kernel as needed.  I hope that other large projects will eventually adopt Linux's approach, unquote.  And cattle and finishes, unfortunately, all of this CVE spam could not have happened at a worse  time.  Just as the Linux kernel team was getting its CNA status,  NIST, you know, NIST was slowing down its management of the NVD database,  where all CVEs are compiled and enriched.  NIST cited a staff shortage and a sudden rise in the number of reported vulnerabilities,  mainly from the IOT space.  Having one of every fifth CVE being a Linux non-security bug is not helping nIST at all right now.  So, unfortunately, we depend upon CVE's to convey true problems that require remediation of some kind.  having the Linux kernel project spewing CVEs  for non-vonability bugs really is an abuse of the system.  Yeah.  And they're creating a lot of noise,  which is obscuring the real security issue.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It has a real potential of just causing people,  let's cry wolf.  Right.  Your good, it's useful.  You could end up blunting the effect.  Yep.

Ha ha ha.  Stive Jibsen.  Yes.  So, GRC's email system continues to mature.  And I could not be more pleased with my decision  to create a more convenient means for our listeners  to send podcasts feedback.  Some listeners have noted  that nowhere on GRC's website,  do I prominently display the email address,  security now at GRC.com.  That's true, and that's also deliberate.  It's clearly not a secret,  since Leo and I will be mentioning it every week here.  But to whatever degree is possible,  I'd like to reserve inbound email  to that mailbox for podcast feedback.  There will be a temptation to send things to me  that I already pay Sue and Greg to handle.  So I'd prefer not to short circuit our traditional lines  of communication.  So once again, security now at GRC.com.  And I imagine everybody can remember that.  I did want to let everyone know that after last week's podcast,  I improved GRC's email registration system  to also accept email that registered against a user's  from header. The moment I made that change, all false positive rejections stopped. We haven't  had a single one since then. So anyone who may have had initial difficulty registering with  private domains fronted by Gmail or some other email, an automation service should no longer  have any trouble and may do so. So again, I was a little overprotective initially. That's fixed.  It's easier now.  Several people have been worried that they haven't ever received a single piece of email  from me.  They're expecting the flow of weekly podcast announcements.  So I wanted to assure everyone that so far I have never sent one.  I'm still working to finish up the front end email registration bounce processing, which  I expect to complete this week.  I always wondered about the practice of asking people to enter their email addresses twice.  I understood that it was to catch typos.  And when I designed GRC's e-commerce system back in 2003, that's what I had it due to.  But I did that mostly because everyone at the time was doing it.  Now I know why.  The email registration system I have does not do that.  And it's somewhat surprising to see how many typos are present in email that cannot be delivered.  It turns out that dot-vom is not a valid top-level domain, and that the V key is right  next to the C key.  The good news is that such typos only result in a brief stumble since this is part  of an immediate email confirmation loop, so anyone who doesn't receive a confirmation  email returns to try again and they will probably enter their email correctly and maybe  by typing it more carefully, the second time.  Since I think that asking everyone only once because they receive immediate confirmation  is more convenient for most people, I'm going to leave the system as it is.  I'm not going to ask everybody to enter it twice.  The work I'm doing right now is in automating the process of receiving any immediate delivery  attempt failures from our email server and holding that information for someone's second  attempt when they don't get the first email confirmation and then come back and try again.  There are a surprising number of mailbox unknown or mailbox over quota bounce backs that  I would like to be able to present to someone when they retry using an address that just  failed for that reason.  So once that system is in place, I'll actually begin sending email and the system will  be up and running.  Okay, so I got a kick out of this fictional dialogue with an AI, which was titled ordering  a pizza in 2024.  This was shared by a listener via Twitter.  There's no indication of the dialogue's origin, but it's definitely worth sharing.  So the caller says apparently in another phone,  is this pizza hut?  No, sir.  It's Google Pizza.  Caller, oh, I must have dialed a wrong number.  Sorry.  No, sir.  Google bot pizza hut last month.  Ha ha ha.  Okay, I would like to order a pizza.  Do you want your usual, sir?  My usual, you know me?  According to our caller ID data sheet,  The last 12 times you called, you ordered an extra large pizza with three cheeses,  sausage pepperoni mushrooms and meatballs on a thick crust.  Colors is super.  That's what I'll have.  Google, may I suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta, arugula, sundried tomatoes,  and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust?  The caller says, what?  I don't want a vegetarian pizza?  Google, your cholesterol is not good, sir.  How the hell do you know that?  Well, we cross reference to your home phone number with your medical records.  We have the result of your blood tests for the last seven years.  Uh, okay, but I do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza.  I already take medication for my cholesterol.  Excuse me, sir.  But you have not taken your medication regularly.  According to our database, you purchased only a box of 30 cholesterol tablets once at Lloyd's  pharmacy for months ago.  Of course says, I bought more from another pharmacy.  That doesn't show on your credit card statement.  I paid in cash.  But you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement.  I have other sources of cash.  That doesn't show on your latest tax returns unless you bought them using an un-clared,  declared income source, which of course is against the law.  Colors says, what the heck?  Google says, I'm sorry, sir.  We use such information only with the soul and tension of helping you.  The caller says, enough already.  I'm sick of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and all the others.  I'm going to go, I'm going to an island without the internet, TV, where there's no phone  service and no one to watch me or spy on me.  Google says, I understand sir, but you need to renew your passport first.  It expired six weeks ago.  So anyway, yes, if Microsoft recall does evolve into a semi smart, personal assistant,  it better not start offering helpful advice or maybe people will think about deleting it.  Or using my force coming freeware app.  I will see.  End all recolent.  I keep trying.  Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, and Nathan, I said, I'll just make sure you don't have a mouthful  of coffee.  Nathan Hartley tweeted, I would love Windows co-pilot on my work PC.  Though, we have far more local admins who have access to everything that I'm comfortable  with.  I will wait a bit for my personal PC.  Now, of course, Nathan is suggesting that an appropriate environment having access to a comprehensive  history of everything that has been done on a company machine might be useful.  But he wonders what access to that information will also be available to local admins.  And I think that's another very good point.  All indications are that in their enthusiasm for this idea, which is understandable, Microsoft  failed to give sufficient thought to just how transformative a change it would be for a  machines entire usage history to be captured and stored in detail. We know that enterprise  machines are owned and operated by their companies who oversee them in their security.  So how does recall fit into that environment? They're due appear to be some questions  still to be answered.  Tom, who's Tom Lawrence Tech.  This was shared via a public tweet.  So it appeared in my timeline  because he referenced at SGGRC.  He said, I just had a great conversation  with at DR the nerd about Adam Network, PF Sense  and they don't talk to stranger's system.  He said, I'll be doing some testing  but for those who want to learn more right now,  check out h2dps slash slash adamnet.works and at sggrc episode 946 and he provided a link.  Now of course, DR the nerd that would be David Rettacop, who in my first met when they were  an early advertiser on this podcast, I think right from the get go Leo with the candidate  based nerds on site guys at the time. And of course as we know David is now part of the  team at Adam Networks and I discussed their work during episode 946 and noted that they have  some very interesting and very mature perimeter security technology which definitely worth  looking at. Okay, listener John Liptack asked Steve. I've been caught up in Google domains in the  Google domains to square space DNS migration. And due to square spaces terms of service, I want to move.  However, due to the number of security issues with DNS, as well as your wonderful testing software,  I've been unable to find the episode where you give your recommendation for a domain name provider.  Can you remind me who you recommend? <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> Thanks, John.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> The name John is trying to recall is hover.com.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> They are my absolute hands-down favorite domain name registrar.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> They were also a Twitter sponsor, though that followed my switching to them from away from<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> network solutions who was GRC's original registrar with whom I registered the GRC.com<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> domain back in December of 1991, which was a few months after the domain Microsoft.com<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> was first registered.

I can't even tell you, like the nonsense I have.  No way to.  What the heck?  They're all, they're all there at hover.  Stephen, Tampa, Florida sent me a note regarding the  We've talked about a couple of times.  He said, I just want to let you know that after hearing your mention, the token of the token  two keys on the podcast, I ordered two of the T2F2 NFC dual keys.  I received them today.  I immediately downloaded the Windows app from their website and entered in a pin.  I then tried them with BitWordon.  entering them in BitWarden under Web Often, I was able to, in other, in other words,  the, the, the, the past keys, I was able to log in in every case, USBA, USBC, and NFC,  using either the web app or an Android phone. Of note, is that to activate the key, you  need to squeeze contacts together and not just touch the contacts, regards, Steve and  Tampa, Florida. So that's welcome feedback. And I'm glad they were that those token two keys were  not a boom dog. They really do look like solid solutions. The ones I ordered were back ordered  and they've not shown up yet, but I'm not in a huge hurry. Now yesterday, a listener Bob Grant  wrote through the new email system with some of the best on the ground feedback about the current  state of Pasquise support that I've seen so far.  What Bob had to share was of crucial importance because it clearly dispels the belief  that all websites which support Pasquise support multiple Pasquise, thereby allowing multiple  physical donggles to be used without restriction.  That's not the case.  So here's Bob's great reporting.  He said, Hi Steve.  I've always enjoyed trying out the bleeding edge, and I've been using Ubekees for over a decade,  so I recently replaced one of my Ubekees with a token 2 key from Switzerland to get its 100  past key support.  I then went about registering multiple Ubekees and my new token 2 keys plus bidwarden  at multiple sites.  For instance, I have 5 Gmail accounts and 2 Microsoft accounts I wanted to use with the  past keys.  I discovered a few indications that we have a ways to go before this is ready or easy for  prime time.  For security purposes, all the hardware keys require a pin to unlock the key for each  login to a site.  This is as opposed to BitWarden, which will do it for you while the vault is unlocked,  or if locked can use a biometric authentication which is pretty quick.  Further, the hardware token operation requires an initial touch to bring up the pin prompt  followed by another touch after the pin to perform the authentication.  token two keys require the phyto recommended six digit pin, whereas UB keys allow for a  more convenient for digit pin, as usual security trumps convenience. Next, I found that a bunch  of sites do not follow the phyto recommendations. eBay, PayPal, and Lowe's only allow a single  past key to be registered. This of course means you have to use something like  bit-or-din that can sink between devices rather than a single hardware key which is a point of failure.  Kayaq, LinkedIn, Adobe, and Amazon do not allow naming the keys as you enroll them.  Linked in calls them Pasquille 1, 2, 3, etc. Amazon has the date, but not the time the key  was enrolled. So there's no way to differentiate unless you enroll on different days.  The effect of this is that if you need to revoke a key that has lost, you don't know which  in rolled key you should be deleted from the site.  All other sites I used allowed naming at creation and some even allow later renaming  of enrolled keys.  Most sites allow quite a few keys, but linked in only allows five.  Surprisingly, Amazon AWS seems to only allow Fido 1 style U2F mode keys, not Fido  2 for PASC key login. Many sites allow keys from one type of device, for example iOS or iPad  OS, but not from another, like Firefox on a desktop. Chrome seems to have better support,  and I think MS Edge has good support although I didn't test extensively. Chrome allows  managing keys, you know, token 2 or Ubakey, from its settings security menu within the browser.  that's so you can list, delete, edit, etc. This all suggests that it's still early days,  but I still kind of prefer my UBAKI to my Token 2 key and I'm doubtful I'll get to a hundred  past keys anytime soon. The Token 2 is Fatter and more bulky and at least feels a little more  vulnerable than the U-B-Kee. Also, at one point, my T2 stopped responding and prompting  for a pin when I tried to log in. But I was able to use my U-B-Kee's without a problem.  Once I rebooted my laptop, the token 2 key resumed responding. I don't know whether  the off-infestructure would blacklist a key, but I'm going to keep an eye on it.  Now for the record, my guess is that the token 2 Windows app probably froze somehow,  that that's what the reboot cured. And of course, you know, USB is always because it came  along after Windows had already launched and a lot of it been written. USB has always been a  little bit flaky. So anyway, he finishes. I'd like to see PayPal allow multiple keys so I could  switch to using a hardware key for added security. But I'll need to use BitWard and with PayPal  until then. It's disappointing to me that banks investment houses and other high value targets  do not currently support Pasquise at all. In fact, most are still using SMS text  second factors rather than Google auth or even the older U2F which could use keys for  multiple factor authentication. Hardware keys can also be used for SSH authentication for more  security for your SSH sessions. Each one takes the same type of slot as a Pasquise and can also store  the SSH key info which allows it to move the public key from system to system.  It's easy to see.  What an uphill battle squirrel faced when even given all the support behind Fido 2 its implementation  remains spotty and uncertain.  So, wow.  Thank you very much Bob.  That's some terrific feedback about the current state of Paschee support.  All of this does suggest that today's optimal solution, driven by the fact that there  are sites which will only accept a single pass key enrollment.  You never know when you're going to hit one.  Would be to enroll one or more where possible hardware dongles only for the highest security  sites where that's what you want.  to then otherwise use a cross-platform password manager,  such as BitWarden, a sponsor of the Twitter network,  and use that hardware dongle to in turn unlock BitWarden  if you want more than BitWarden's biometric unlocking.  In that fashion, any site's single-passkey support  won't present a problem, since BitWarden is able to present  that site single passki from any bit warden supported device.  And now that it's support for mobile devices is shipping,  it's on all platforms everywhere.  Elisner using his initials BE surprised me.  He wrote, Hi Steve,  thank you for the new email system since I don't use any social media.  Regarding code signing HSM's,  My friend and I are on top of the development of a hobby software used by only 15 to 20 people.  We used to share the code signing keys between us and one other developer.  But when I went to renew the code signing certificate, I saw there is no longer an option  to be able to sign any code without an HSM.  Do you have any idea how we can still have the three developers able to sign to code?  Thank you for all your work, longtime listener, and a club-twit member.  Yay! Thank you!  Okay, so this was news to me.  In a follow-up note, BE sent some links so that I didn't need to track them down myself  and sure enough. Reading from the knowledge base maintained by my favorite certificate authority  digisert under the title, new private key storage requirement for code signing certificates they  write. Starting on June 1, 2023. Industry standards will require private keys for standard code signing  certificates to be stored on hardware certified as FIPS 140 level 2 common criteria EAL4  plus or equivalent. In other words, an HSM, some sort of a hardware dongle. This change  they write strengthens private key protection for code signing certificates and allows  and aligns it with EV extended validation code signing certificate private key protection.  Wow. This is actually troubling. First, as I previously reported, the enhanced trust  that Microsoft was originally conveying to any code signed with a significantly more expensive  EVSURTS, which have always required storage in an HSM, has been revoked, so that there is no  longer any benefit to having an EV certificate for code signing. No one cares. But now the  industry has moved to requiring all code signing to be performed inside and by a hardware  dongle. It was already a problem that any code signing was becoming a requirement, which  is what we've been seeing due to the increasing prevalence of malicious code. The problem  is that many open source projects are hobby projects like that of our listener, which  would otherwise not need to be signed. So this general signing requirement was already  imposing a burden on developers, but now the stakes are raised even higher, requiring  the purchase of hardware for the storage of any code signing key.  And as a side effect, as our listener notes, this also prevents small teams of hobby developers  from sharing a single certificate among themselves for the purpose of defraining and  advertising its cost across multiple users.  And it's not as if this is a one time event  since search, expire, and require periodic renewal.  The hardware won't need renewing,  but an updated certificate will need to be installed.  So what I expect will happen is it will start  to begin seeing code signing surfers appearing,  so that multiple members of a team,  distributed physically geographically,  will still be able to share a single HSM  dongle among themselves.  And when that happens,  I sure hope they get their security right  since there will be tremendous pressure  from malware authors to also get their malicious software signed  by those same code signing servers.  Now as we know, I wrote such a thing myself,  as part of SpinRite 61's launch,  since everyone's spinRite download is unique  and needs to be individually signed.  And I commented here a few months ago  when we learned that EV search  were losing their special treatment  that I had apparently wasted my time doing that  because my next certificate would not be EV, and would therefore not need to be contained within  an HSM. Turns out, my time was not wasted after all. Everyone whose signs code will need to  use an HSM to do so as soon as their current non-HSM code signing certificate expired. Wow.  yet another tax put on the good guys by malware. That's it's unfortunate and again  it is there certainly nothing prevents anyone from automating the code signing  process. As I found due to Microsoft's pathetic documentation for doing this, for  For me, it was a heavy lift.  I got it working.  It's been surprisingly, which is to say utterly bulletproof, since I finally finished it.  And I'm thankful for that.  But boy, I'm sure somebody will do it for Linux and open source it.  And then code signing servers will be something we start to see. <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> And for what it's worth be, it is possible to rekey a certificate for installation in a</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> second hardware dongle.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> So if you ended up purchasing two dongle's one for each location, you could still only</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> purchase one certificate key. The process of installing it does not give you any control over it.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> This is by design so that it can only get installed in a single device.

What happened to code the Microsoft.com?  So the page I ran across at Microsoft and I don't recall how it came to my attention  has the intriguing title examining the deception infrastructure in place behind code.microsoft.com  Okay, what the deception infrastructure what?  Well it turns out that the reader is not left to wonder long since this piece starts out  quote, the domain name code.microsoft.com has an interesting story behind it. Today, it's not  linked to anything, but that wasn't always true. And as a matter of fact, yesterday I did an  NS look up and the domain and there's no name resolution, so they completely disconnected it.  He writes, this is the story of one of my most successful honeypot instances and how it enabled  Microsoft to collect varied threat intelligence against a broad range of actor groups targeting  Microsoft. I'm writing this now as we've decided to retire this capability.  Okay, now that's not the good part. This astonishing part is how this got started.  So here's what he wrote. Code.microsoft.com was an early domain used to host visual studio code  and some helpful documentation.  The domain was active until around 2021.  When this documentation was moved to a new home.  After the move, the site behind the domain  was an Azure App Service site  that performed redirection,  thus preventing existing links from being broken.  Then, sometime around mid-2021,  the existing Azure App Service instance was shut down, leaving code.microsoft.com, pointing  to a service that no longer existed.  This created a vulnerability.  This situation is what's called a dangling subdomain, which refers to, as far as I know,  Microsoft just made up, never heard that before.  a dangling subdomain, which refers to a subdomain that once pointed to a valid resource,  but now hangs in limbo. Again, never limbo's not a term. That's something you normally  do where you have to just like lean over backwards and get underneath of horizontal bar.  I don't know, limbo, okay. So he says, imagine a subdomain like blog.subdomain.com that's  used to handle a blog application. When the underlying service is deleted, the blog engine,  you might update your page link and assume the service has been retired. However, there  is still a subdomain pointing to the blog. What? This is now dangling and cannot be resolved.  Okay, he says a malicious actor can discover the dangling subdomain.  Except no, it's a subdomain of your own domain.  So a malicious actor, what do you mean?  They can discover it.  Anyways, it says,  I'm malicious, this is what he said.  A malicious actor can discover the dangling subdomain.  Provision a cloud Azure resource with the same name.  And now visiting blog.sumdomain.com will redirect to the attacker's resource.  What?  He says, now they control the content.  He says this happened in 2021 when the domain was temporarily used to host a malware,  command and control service.  Thanks to multiple reports from our great community, this was quickly spotted and taken down  before it could be used. As a response to this, Microsoft now has more robust tools in place  to catch similar threats. Okay, so first of all, let me just say, holy crap. And I hope that  that no one listening to this, while driving just lost control of their vehicle, because  this is nothing short of insane, that that could happen.  I'm not trained up on Azure, and on how or why it might be possible for a so called dangling  subdomain of Microsoft.com to be casually commandeered by someone not Microsoft by giving  their own Azure Cloud instance the same name as an unassigned Microsoft subdomain.  All I can surmise is that there must be some serious architectural design problems over  in Microsoft land for that to ever have been possible. That's just nuts. But in any event,  this author continues by posting the rhetorical question, how did it become a honeypot?  He says today, it's relatively routine for MSTIC to take control of an attacker-controlled  resource and repurpose these for threat intelligence collection, right? Like, you know, they'll take  over some domain that was an existing command and control server and run it in order to, you  know, gain intelligence. He wrote, taking control of a malware command and control environment  for example enables us to potentially discover new infected nodes. Right. In other words, because  the infected machines will be falling home to the mothership for instructions.  So he says, at the time of the dangling code, go code.microsoft.com. Subdomain.  He says, this process was relatively new. We wanted a good test case to show the value  of taking over resources versus taking them down.  So instead of removing the dangling subdomain, we pointed it instead to a node in our existing  vast honeypot sensor network.  He says, and just for anyone who doesn't know, but everyone does, a honeypot is a decoy  system designed to attract a monitor malicious activity.  Honeypot's can be used to collect information about the attackers, their tools, their  techniques and their intentions. Honeypots can also be used to divert the attackers from  the real targets to consume and waste their time and resources. Microsoft's Honeypots  sensor network has been in development since 2018.  It's used to collect information on emerging threats to both our and our customers' environments.  The data we collect helps us be better informed when a new vulnerability is disclosed  and gives us retrospective information on how, when and where, exploits are developed.  This data becomes enriched with other tools Microsoft has available,  turning it from a source of raw threat data into threat intelligence.  This is then incorporated into a variety of our security products.  Customers can also get access to this via sentinels emerging threat feed.  The honey pot itself is a custom design framework written in C-sharp.  It enables security researchers to quickly deploy anything from a single HTTP exploit handler  in one or two lines of code, all the way up to complex protocols like SSH and VNC.  For even more complex protocols, we can hand off incoming connections to real systems  when we detect exploit traffic and revert these shortly after.  It is our mission to deny threat actors access to resources or enable them to use our infrastructure  to create further victims.  That's why in almost all scenarios the attacker is playing in a high interaction simulated  environment.  No code is run.  Everything is a trick or deception designed to get them to reveal their intentions.  substantial engineering has gone into our simulation framework.  Today, get this.  Over 300 pseudo vulnerabilities can be triggered through the same exploit proof of concepts  available in places like GitHub and exploit DB.  Thread actors can communicate with over 30 different protocols and can even log in and  deploy scripts and execute payloads that look like they're operating on a real system.  There is no real system and almost everything is being simulated.  Okay, so wow, let me just say props where it's due and it's definitely due here.  That is some seriously cool technology.  They've created the matrix.  A simulated, deliberately vulnerable environment that's designed to lure bad guys into believing  that they've successfully exploited any of more than 300 known vulnerabilities on a machine,  while retaining the control that the actual exploitation of the vulnerability was designed  to bypass.  So it looks like a duck and it cracks like a duck, but it ain't no duck.  Very, very cool tech.  So he continues.  It's impossible that in standing up a honeypot on an important domain like Microsoft.com,  it wasn't possible for attackers to use this as an environment to perform other web attacks.  that might rely on same origin trust, meaning they had to make sure that a bad guy  could not originate their attacks from inside Microsoft.com because that's where code.microsoft.com  was. You can imagine that everybody knows what Microsoft.com networks are and it would not  not be a stretch to imagine that there are some enterprises that have white listed Microsoft  networks after having to put lots of individual white list IPs.  Some guys just said, oh, forget it.  Let's just white list the whole, you know, slash 16 or whatever Microsoft has.  So we said, so again, origin of trust, they could not allow the origin to be Microsoft.com.  So we said, demiticate this further, we added the sandbox policy to the pages, which prevents  these kinds of attacks.  So, he writes, what have we learned from Mahani Pah?  Our sensor network has contributed to many successes over the years.  We've presented these at computer security conferences in the past as well as shared our  data with academia and the community.  We incorporate this data into our security products to enable them to be aware of the latest  threats.  In recent years, this capability has been crucial to understanding the zero day and end-day  ecosystem.  During the log for shell incident, we were able to use our sensor network to track each  iteration of the underlying vulnerability and associated proof of concept all the way back  to GitHub. This helped us understand the groups involved in productionizing the exploit  and where it was being targeted. Our data enables internal teams to be much better prepared to  remediate and provides the analysis for detection authors to improve products like Microsoft  Defender for endpoint in real time. That's MDE. The team developing this capability also works  closely with the MSRC who track our own security issues.  When the exchange proxy log-on vulnerability was announced, we had already written a full  exploit handler in our environment to track and understand not just the exploit but the  groups deploying it.  This kind of situational awareness enables us to give clearer advice to the industry, better  protect our customers and integrate new threats we are seeing into Windows and  Defender Windows Defender and MDE.  The domain, code.microsoft.com, was often critical to the success of this,  as well as a useful early warning system.  When new vulnerabilities have been announced,  threat actors can often be too consumed,  with trying to use the vulnerability as quickly as possible,  than checking for deception infrastructure like a honeypot.  As a result, code.microsoft.com often saw exploits first.  Many of these exploits were attributed to thread actors  and STIC already tracks.  Okay, so it is very interesting that the announcement  of a new vulnerability immediately triggers a mass frenzy.  But we've talked about this effect before, right?  As attackers who are literally everywhere,  screwing to take advantage of it before machines are patched.  Okay, so the author continues,  what happened next?  He says, the code subdomain had been known  to bug bounty researchers for several years.  So whenever they would receive a report  from someone who believed that they had discovered a critical vulnerability for this domain.  These would be closed to let them know they had found a honeypot.  We've asked these security professionals to refrain from publishing details of this service  in an effort to protect the value we received from it.  We've also understood, for a while, that this subdomain would eventually need to be retired  once its existence had become too well known to be a value.  That time finally arrived.  On April 25th, a sudden uptick in traffic to the subdomain and posts on Twitter revealed  that the domain was being investigated by broad groups of individuals since this discovery  meant that the secret was out, and the subdomain had lost its value, we decided to fully  reveal the truth and retire the system. I have a chart in the show notes that shows this,  where they're basically ticking along, it almost nothing, and then over the course of a couple  days, the traffic just explodes. He said the timeline gives an order of events from our perspective.  It's unknown exactly how the full exploit URL of our server  and that up in Google search database.  But it looks like this.  And they associated Discovery on Twitter slash X  culminated in almost 80,000 80,000 we chat exploits in a three-hour period.  It's unlikely that Google crawler would have naturally found the URL.  Our current theory is that a security researcher found this and submitted a report to Microsoft.  As part of this process, either the Chrome browser or another app, found this URL and submitted  it for indexing.  Okay, so in other words, it's very difficult to keep anything a secret on the Internet.  It's easy to imagine that Google would have set up Chrome to feed URLs back to them  for bot crawling indexing. That way users of Chrome are unwittingly providing Google with  links to index as it means for assuring that Google bots are able to discover everything.  Even things that are not pointed to by anybody else as in this case.  In this case, they somehow discovered a secret that Microsoft had been trying to keep  quiet for several years.  The timeline showed that in March, the WeChat exploit appeared in Google search results  for the first time.  April 15th, a redacted screenshot of an exploit mitigation was posted online and some debate  followed as to whether the domain was for the decode.microsoft.com subdomain.  Six days later on the 21st of April, Google Trends show that many people were now searching  for the code domains. Three days after that on the 24th, they start noticing a significant  uptake in traffic to the subdomain, and finally on the 26th, they are hit with a 126,000  times more requests than average. They write, by the 26th of April, we were handling 160,000  requests per day, up from the usual between five and one hundred.  Most of these requests were to a single endpoint handling a vulnerability in the WeChat broadcast  plugin for WordPress, that CV-E-2018-16283.  This enabled anyone to run a command from a parameter in the URL.  Looking at these URLs, we found 11,000 different commands being attempted.  Most of these pushed a message by some group or another stating that the site had been hacked  by them, so just ego.  This was a simulation, so nothing happened.  Removing these messages gave a clearer picture of the kinds of commands people were  entering. Most commands entered were Linux recon commands. These attempted to find out what  the system was, what files it contained, and more broadly what value it was to Microsoft.  The next biggest group were running command. These ranged from basics Linux commands  like who am I, but a few enterprising folks went on to run scripts of various languages.  Most people who interacted didn't get further than the Wii chat exploit.  Over the three busiest days, 63 different exploits in total were triggered.  The biggest surprise was that most researchers stuck to HTTP, only three groups probed the other  ports and even fewer locked into the many other services that were available.  Some of the best investigation came from a Twitter handle at simply lurking 2 on Twitter  slash X, who after discovering that the system was a honeypot continued to analyze what  we had in place and constructed.  First constructing a Rick roll and then a URL that when visited would display a message  to right-click and save a payload.  With so much information now publicly available, the value of this sub-domain was diminished.  On April 26th, we replaced the site with a 404 message and are working on retiring the  sub-domain completely.  However, our ongoing data collection efforts are undeminished.  Microsoft runs many of these collection services across multiple data centers.  Our concept has been proven and we have rolled out similar capabilities at higher scales  as many other nations or locations worldwide.  This continues to give us a detailed picture  of emerging threats.  So that's the story of the rise and fall of a hunting pot.  Which Microsoft inadvertently created,  but then managed to put to great use and advantage  for several good years before its identity finally leaked  was made public thus rendering it useless. We've also seen how the tip of the iceberg for a  honeypot is that it can detect that something is wrong on a network. That's generally sufficient  for most purposes. But this, but as we see, this can also be taken far beyond simple detection  with a sufficiently advanced vulnerability simulator  to reveal exactly what bad guys will do  when they're given more rope to hang themselves.  Wow, I used to go to code.markersoft.com all the time to download VS code.  I had no idea that they had abandoned it.  That is a wild story.  Wow.  Yeah.  And Leo again, the idea that not having something responding to code.microsoft.com,  which used to be hosted by Azure, allowed somebody else to register that.  Again, it's amazing. I hope that there's somebody's looking at this architecture because  something is broken if that's possible.  you shouldn't be able to go to a create a subdomain.  If the domain is owned by somebody else,  that doesn't make any sense.  I know.  I know.  It's in a safe.  Is it still that way?  I mean, should I worry about Twitter TV?  People getting subdomains on our own.  Are you on Azure?  No.  That's not.  Who?  I'm not.  What are we?  No one's ever heard of this.  This is just nuts.  It's crazy.  The only thing that's so.  So code.microsoft.com must have pointed to an IP in Azure.  Right.  And something is rotten and done, Marsh.  I've got another against Denmark, but like there, that's wow.  She'd be blaming the register.  I mean, isn't that or the DNS resolver, isn't that?  No, no.  It's somebody somehow created their own Azure instance.  And because it was named code.microsoft.com.  It's all in the name.  somehow it glued itself to that subdomain,  which they called dangling a dangling subdomain.  No, it was never heard of a dangling subdomain.  Subdomains don't dangling.  They made that up.  What a story.  Well, at least they got some good out of it, right?  I think that's.  Yeah, it did.  They turned it around.  The fact that it was in Microsoft  and they had some, some seriously cool tech.  I mean, again,  what I think must be the case as I was reading this to our listeners I was thinking  why don't we get the sense in general  that Microsoft is this good  i mean they were really they are there are parts of Microsoft that are really good  mark people they're just so they're buried so deeply down  in in the infrastructure that  you know you just talk to morons on the surface  while i don't even think it's that i think it's just so complex the things fault  through the cracks. So David Reddock,  So, Leo, just go to answers.microsoft.com and you will swim in moron the most moronic nonsense  you have ever seen.  The intern did it.  God, the intern's vault.  David Renekop, who's we were just talking about is in our discord.  I guess you're a club member.  Thank you, David.  He said, as your is the authoritative DNS for an Azure tenant.  And there's your problem right there, right?  They've decided.  We don't need to think DNA service.  Well, we'll do it.  We'll resolve the domain.  We can do that.  Steve, you've always been full of fascinating stuff today.  It was no exception.  Another great episode of security now.  In the vault, 978, done 22 to go.  We can begin a new era.
