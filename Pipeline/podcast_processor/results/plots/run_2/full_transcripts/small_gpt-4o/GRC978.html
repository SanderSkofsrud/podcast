     It's time for security now. Steve Gibson is here.  He has a rebuttal to Microsoft's rebuttal  to last week's accusation all about Microsoft Recall.  He still says it might want to hold off on that one.  Apple gets a password manager.  Is it good enough for government work?  We'll also talk about the use of AI and coding.  Is AI going to kill the future of code?  And what Microsoft did when they had a little, little error  that's ended up becoming a very useful tool  to go after bad guys.  It's all coming up next on Security Now.  Podcasts you love.  From people you trust.  This is Twitter.  This is Security Now with Steve Gibson, episode 978,  recorded Tuesday, June 11th, 2024, the rise and fall of code.Microsoft.com.  It's time for security now to show you wait all week for as Steve says, it's Tuesday. It  must be Steve Gibson. Hello, Steve.  Hey, Leo. We were out walking with some friends around the neighborhood yesterday and I, there's  at there's like three long legs of our community.  And after doing two of them,  they, we all started down the third.  And I said, well, nope, it's podcast night.  I gotta get back to working on the podcast.  I love it.  So I got the, the walk was cut short  and Laurie had been pushing me to start earlier on Mondays  cause I was, I would be trying to get work done  in through the mornings,  but invariably it would creep into the afternoon.  And then it'd be like, oh shoot, I should have been, I should be further long.  So now I'm just not even trying to get anything done on Monday except work on the podcast.  Now that's the, that's the, the driving force.  We're seeing the result of that today because we have 24 pages of show notes as a consequence  of me having gotten an extra early start yesterday.  Now, normally the people who listen to us at 1.5x do so because I kind of plot along.  There'll be no plotting today because we have a lot of ground to cover.  So if you are hearing me at 1.5x and wondering why I seem to be going a little faster than  usual, you might want to consider dropping down to 1x and hearing it at normal speed.  We got a bunch of things to talk about on today's podcast, 978 for Patch Tuesday.  I am mourning the fact and if one of our listeners is listening, someone tweeted me a couple  weeks ago this picture of a pipe that had just had patches all over it like crazy and  silver like screw on straps and it looked like this thing was on life support.  I thought that is the most perfect picture of the week for Microsoft patch Tuesday.  But I don't know what happened to the picture.  So maybe if the person is listening, you can send it to me again and I'll hold it for  July's, Patch Tuesday.  We're going to talk about something really interesting, which is I titled this, the rise  and fall of code.microsoft.com, which everyone would recognize as a subdomain, the code subdomain  of Microsoft.com.  But essentially the way what happened started was with an architectural failure, the scope  of which I can hardly grasp.  I have no idea what's going on up there in Redmond that what I will describe could have  happened but it did.  But they turned it around.  I mean, they still have some problems to solve, but they managed to repurpose this mistake  into something that ended up creating a ton of intelligence for them, collecting a ton  of intelligence.  Anyway, we're going to have a lot of fun with that.  But first, we're going to talk about how Microsoft has responded to the tidal wave of criticism  that they've received over recall.  And what about Google?  Who else recently lost control of their data?  Apple devices will be getting a password manager?  What?  What about iCloud?  I thought we already had that.  Is that a drone recording a wedding or is that the Chinese Communist Party surveillance  device?  Whoa.  What did Slash Data's survey of more than 10,000 coders around the world reveal about  their use of AI today and their choice of language.  And if AI's can code, which they seem able to do,  then what's the career future for programmers?  We have some feedback on that. Also,  why has the Linux project, the Linux kernel project,  suddenly begun spewing CVEs in great number?  Will we be able to order pizza in the future?  or should we just give up now or maybe order all your pizza today and you know freeze it.  What did one listener discover when he attempted to register his new passkey devices across the  internet and as I said how did a stunning mistake at Microsoft turn into a gold mine of attacker  intelligence. So not a slow podcast today for the second podcast of June.  We know Microsoft never makes any mistakes.  Oh, Leo, wait till you hear this one.  Oh, God.  I just, when I read this, I thought,  and this is from them, this is their own blog posting.  Somebody confessed this, which I, first of all, I thought,  oh, but like, really?  Well, anyway, we'll get there.  We'll get there.  It's stunning.  I know we've got 26 pages, so let me hurry up here <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> and tell you about our first sponsor of the show today.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> wonderful company I've been using for some time, Milio Photos.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> This is, I think their first time on security now. Now,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> because it's security now,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I want to tell you a little bit about Milio Photos. It's a photo storage,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> actually document storage, photos, videos, and documents that backs up.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Everything you've got puts it on every device you have.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> But most importantly for you, our secure now listeners is absolutely secure.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It does not use the cloud if you don't want it to. And if you do,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It's up to you.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It encrypts it.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Steve calls it pre-egress encryption.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> We'll call it pre-internet encryption for the purposes of this.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Many of us rely on our clouds, right, for digital day-to-day, many apps and services,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> but they're just not protecting our data as we should.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It's one of the reasons, one of many reasons I am a Milio Photos Plus user.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I have, according to this, this is Milio, 211,274 images.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And 211, and does it bog down?<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> No, it is a place to store them.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It's automatically doing face recognition, I say,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> which everybody is at first, you know,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> that's my wife, that's my kids and so forth.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And then it goes through all the rest of the images,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> matches them beautifully.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I also tell it a few things about location,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> but then it finds, it says pictures of churches,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> pictures of churches near an ocean, pictures of fish,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> pictures of fish coming out of the river.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It's amazing.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It is the best photo categorization tool ever.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> MyLeo Photos Plus gives you a single consolidated library<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> for photos, videos, and other files on your Mac,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> on your PC, on your Android, on your iPhone, everywhere.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And I have it everywhere.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It's smart too, you could say.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I just want thumbnails on this one.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I want originals on the one with the biggest drive.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And of course, when you download the,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> from the thumbnail, you can download the original<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> at any time, you could do some editing in there.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It makes it effortless to curate, to protect,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> to organize and sync your files from anywhere.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Even social media pulls in from Instagram, from Facebook.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I got all my photos off of Google.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> I did Google takeout on my Google photos.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Milio Photos Plus automatically imported it<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> and then dedupted it.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> You may say, well, 211,000 photos, Leo,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> you must have duplicates.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> No, not one, because Myleo has the best de-duping.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And the best part of it is the files stay<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> on my local devices, not on distant servers.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Now, there is a Myleo photos for Synology,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> so I actually do have Myleo photos<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> copying to my NAS for backup, but you don't have to.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> In fact, Myleo photos even supports<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> your existing folder structure,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> but it does make it much easier to

class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> They do have cloud backups.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> It will work with Google Drive or Microsoft's cloud<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> or your network attached storage,<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> but they're entirely optional.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> And before it ever goes up to the internet,<span

So we've had endless fun with these bizarre pictures  of gate blocking a path where there's open grass  on either sides of it.  It's like, what?  What?  What?  Just, what were they thinking?  Anyway, somebody had fun over the Microsoft Recall issue  issue and actually relative to their most recent update, this titled Microsoft Recall  and then it shows us one of the pictures that we've shown before, a bright yellow gate in  the middle of a walkway but you know with actually some, it looks like there actually  is footpath traffic on either side because the grass is you know padded down and a little  brown. Anyway, at the bottom it says, referring to this gate, don't worry, it's encrypted.  Yeah, right, right. And we'll have, well actually right now, last Friday, Mary Jo Foley,  yes right, our Mary Jo of Windows Weekly fame, she tweeted, Microsoft bowing to growing  Security-centric criticism is making some tweaks to its coming Windows 11 24h2  Recall app. The first co-pilot plus PCs are still on track to start shipping  June 18th. Okay now today is June 11th so that's one week from today folks and she  said and the tweaks are slated to take effect by then too. Okay so she was  referring of course to a Microsoft Windows blog that is when she said  Microsoft bowing to security-centered concerns posted by the corporate vice  president for Windows plus devices so it appears that Windows plus devices are a  category so that would presumably mean co-pilot plus anyway this guy posted  under the title update on the recall preview feature for co-pilot plus PCs  And as Mary Jo noted, this is clearly in response to the security industry's reaction over the  previous three weeks to the privacy implications that would be present. My contention is, and  I'll be echoing this a couple other times today, in any system that aggregates for all time everything  a user does on their PC. Okay, and I'll have a little more to say specifically about that in  moment but first let's hear from Microsoft. Since a lot of the danger  recall represents is reflected by Microsoft's attitude toward recall I  want to share this VP's entire post. It's not very long but it's important that  their attitude be seen. So bear with me at the start since it's pure Microsoft  marketing speak anyway everyone will recognize it as such. He wrote, today  Today, we're sharing an update on the recall feature in preview for Co-Pilot Plus PCs,  including more information on the setup experience, privacy controls, and additional details on  our approach to security.  On May 20th, we introduced Co-Pilot Plus PCs, our fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs  ever.  co-pilot plus PCs have been re-imaged from the inside out to deliver better  performance and all new AI experiences to help you be more productive, creative,  and communicate more effectively. One of the new experiences exclusive to co-pilot  plus PCs, thank God, is Recall. A new way to instantly find something you've  previously seen on your PC. To create an explorable visual timeline, Recall  periodically takes a snapshot of what appears on your screen. These images are  encrypted, stored, and analyzed locally using on-device AI capabilities to  understand, loosely termed, right, their context. Okay, he says, when logged into  your co-pilot plus PC. You can easily retrace your steps visually using recall to find things  from apps, websites, images and documents that you've seen operating like your own virtual  and completely private photographic memory. You're always in control of what's saved.  You can disable saving snapshots, pause temporarily, filter applications and delete your snapshots  at any time as AI becomes more prevalent. We're re architecting windows. Okay.  Really like there are dialogues from Windows 95 that pop up every so often in  Windows 11. So right. All we've ever seen is some, you know, paving over the previous  pavement, which was over the pavement before that and so on. So, okay, re architecting  Windows to give customers and developers more choice to leverage both the cloud and the  power of local processing on the device may possible by the NURL Processing Unit, the  NPU.  This distributed computing model offers choice for both privacy and security.  All of this work will continue to be guided by our Secure Future Initiative SFI.  Our team is driven by a relentless desire to empower people through the transformative  potential of AI and we see great utility in Recall and the problem it can solve.  We also know for people to get the full value of the experiences like Recall, they have  to trust it.  That's why we are launching Recall in preview on CoatPilot Plus PCs to give customers a  a choice to engage with the feature early or not, and to give us an opportunity to learn  from the types of real world scenarios customers and the Windows community finds most useful.  Okay, so under the subhead of listening to and acting on customer feedback, he wrote,  even before making recall available to customers, we have heard a clear signal that we can make  it easier for people to choose to enable recall on their co-pilot plus PC and improve privacy  and security safeguards. With that in mind, we are announcing updates that will go into  effect before the recall preview ships to customers on June 18th. So like as Mary Jo  said right now before next week. So first he said we are updating the setup  experience of co-pilot plus PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt in to  saving snapshots using recall. He said if you don't proactively choose to turn it  on, it will be off by default. So that's a big change and that matters. The flip side  is how much does it really matter? You know, we've seen how persistent, seductive, and  eventually forceful Microsoft can be when they want to push their users in a certain  direction. It's not that difficult to imagine that while the user might need to  switch it on, Microsoft will not be cautioning the user about the system's  inherent dangers. Rather, they will be promoting the benefits and touting  encryption, locality, security, and all the rest. I believe the upshot will be  that users will turn it on if nothing less just to see what it's about. Because  Microsoft will be making it very appealing. But still, if nothing else, having people  turn it on probably gets them off the hook when things go wrong. After all, well, we  didn't ship it with it on, you turned it on. And it's like, yes, because you told me to.  Okay, anyway, second.  Windows Hello Enrollment is required to enable recall.  In addition, proof of presence is also required  to view your timeline and search in recall.  Okay, so these are all good things, right?  They've created additional hurdles, barriers, requirements  in order to gain access to this.  And I'll just note through the front door,  like gain access the way you're supposed to.  They're not talking about gaining access  the way you're not supposed to.  We'll see how that turns out.  And third, he said,  we're adding additional layers of data protection,  including just-in-time decryption,  protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security.  So recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible  when the user authenticates.  On the other hand,  okay, anyway.  Finally, he said,  in addition, we encrypted this search index database,  which wasn't originally decrypted.  So finally, he says,  secure by design and secure by default.  In line with Microsoft's SFI,  that's the secure initiative thing,  principles,  Before the preview release of Recall to Customers,  we're taking steps to increase data protection.  Copilot plus PCs will launch with just in time decryption  protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security.  So Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible  when the user authenticates.  This gives an additional layer of protection to Recall data  in addition to other default enabled Windows security  features like smart screen and defender, which use advanced AI techniques to help  prevent malware from accessing data like recall. Now, okay, remember that last week,  Kevin Beaumont deliberately used known to Microsoft InfoStealer malware, which  Windows Defender was so slow to recognize that the InfoStealer had already  successfully exfiltrated the user's entire recall history before Defender woke up and  shut it down.  So we should again, the problem is, Microsoft's heart being in the right place doesn't help  anybody because Windows, as we know, is, it's not an exaggeration to say riddled with vulnerabilities  because, you know, more than a hundred are being fixed today in this, uh,  in today's Windows update. Okay. Anyway, he said,  we also know the best way to secure information on a PC is to secure the whole  PC itself. Right. Because that's been going so well.  And he said, we want to reinforce what has previously been shared from David  Weston, vice president of enterprise and OS security about how co-pilot plus  PCs have been designed to be secure by default and share additional details about our security approach.  You know, in other words, unlike all of our previous Windows systems, which really weren't all that secure,  even though we've always told you they were, but oh baby, this time we really and truly mean it, not like all those previous times.  So he said some notable examples of security enhancements include  All co-pilot plus PCs will be secured core PCs bringing which you know doesn't  matter if the windows that runs on it isn't secure but he said bringing  advanced security to both commercial and consumer devices in addition to the  layers of protection in Windows 11 secured core PCs provide advanced  firmware safeguards and dynamic root-of-trust measurement to help protect  from chip to cloud and that's a new phrase that Microsoft is using from chip to cloud  But you know from what cradle to grave  right  Also Microsoft  Pluton  Security processor will be enabled by default. Oh goody on all co-pilot plus PCs  Pluton is a chip to cloud  security technology designed by Microsoft and built by Silicon partners  with zero trust principles at the core. This helps protect credentials,  identities, personal data, and encryption keys, making them significantly harder to  remove from the device even if a user is tricked into installing malware or an  attacker has physical possession of a PC. Again, unfortunately, making sure that a  buggy operating system isn't altered before it boots or while it's booting  doesn't help you once the buggy operating system is running but at least it  didn't get compromised before it booted who cares anyway he said all co-pilot  plus PCs will ship with Windows hello enhanced hello enhanced siting security  this provides more secure biometric siting that eliminates the need for a  password because yeah, who wants those passwords when you can smile at it?  Okay. Under the headline protecting your privacy on co-pilot plus PCs,  we have in our early internal testing,  we've seen different people use recall in the way that works best for them,  blah, blah, blah. I'm going to skip all this because we don't have a lot of time.  And this is just all the same stuff. Uh,  he's basically saying, okay, we heard you,  We're going to turn it off by default.  We're going to seduce people to turn it on.  But if they do, it's their fault, not ours,  because after all, they were the ones who turned it on.  And, oh baby, you know, this is the most secure thing  we've ever made.  So again, as I said, we've always told you that.  Remember Bomber jumping around on stage about Windows XP,  which turned out to be the worst security of any operating system to date that  they'd had anyway. Uh, so basically they're saying,  we heard you and here are all the reasons why  we're going to keep doing what we were doing,  except we're going to turn off by default as I get out of jail free card.  So anyway,  we know that users will be impressed by the sounds of all this  security and I have no doubt that users are going to want to have the power that this provides.  Don't get me wrong. I mean, I get it. This is a seductive feature and that's part of why this is  a double-edged sword. You know, make no mistake about it. This is powerful, but it's because it's  powerful that it's also so dangerous and brings the potential for great harm. Will that harm come  to pass? Well, we'll be here to see. I should also note that I've been asked by a number  of our listeners whether I would consider creating some sort of utility that absolutely  positively guarantees that recall is not running on a machine. We'll see how all this goes,  but I am inclined to do so. And if so, I know what I'll call it. And Leo, I will make sure  you're not sipping coffee when I reveal its name.  Okay, I put the coffee down.  Okay.  Because, yeah, and you'll have to center yourself over your ball because you're going to love  this one.  Anyway, we'll see how it goes.  Kevin Beaumont also weighed in on Microsoft's revised explanation.  He posted this on Mastodon.  She said, obviously, I recommend you do not enable Recall and tell your family not to enable  it too.  It's still labeled a preview and I'll believe it is encrypted when I see it.  There are obviously serious governance and security failures at Microsoft around how  this played out that need to be investigated and suggests they are not  serious about AI safety and I think that raises a really good point it's like  you know they announced this and we saw Satya jumping up and down talking about  how great it was gonna be and the entire security community had a collective  meltdown. So that tells you something about like why they need to have this in  people's machines which again comes back to my theory about what they're  actually planning which is that this will be used to train a some sort of  high-power local assistant and again I get it I mean if that would be so cool  but they've never demonstrated their ability to do anything like this safely.  I should mention that Google with their Chrome OS is also in on the store  everything that happens for possible later use bandwagon. Everyone can sense  that there's huge potential here somewhere, so no one wants to be left out.  Last week, John Solomon, Google's VP in charge of the Chrome OS said that their  so-called memory feature, okay, they maybe talk to Apple about naming things, um, as  that that's what they're currently unofficially calling it, is different from recall, okay,  but then he describes recall. He says, because users will have control of how and where the  memory feature works. Uh, right. Just like recall will offer. So not so different from  recall. And after all, if you turn it off, then you're not going to get it.  So people are not going to turn off.  They're going to have it on if they want it and then suffer the consequences.  If there are any. Anyway,  Google apparently already wants to distance itself from the stink surrounding  the announcement of recall.  The New York times, uh,  on the topic of is it possible to keep secrets last Friday,  270 gigabytes of data belonging to the New York Times,  which I'm quite certain the New York Times wanted  to keep secure and secret,  and which those in charge of securing it  were absolutely and positively certain  was completely secure until it wasn't.  You know, just like Microsoft is absolutely  and positively certain they're going to secure  their users recall data until they don't. In the case of the New York Times, it got  loose. An unknown threat actor leaked the New York Times source code as in all of it, all  270 gigabytes of it. After one of the company's IT guys apparently left a private GitHub access  token in a public code paste.  The leaked data includes the source code of the company's entire public website, mobile  apps and even, for those who are interested, its wordal game.  The 270GB of data being made available on the dark web is mostly un-encrypted.  hacker posted quote basically all source code belonging to the New York Times  company 270 gigabytes there are around 5,000 repos out of them less than 30 are  additionally encrypted I think he said 3.6 million files total uncompressed tar  And I have a picture on in the screen in our  Show notes of the screen that was posted on the dark web with the series of links  So that you too can download  270 gigabytes and find out what the New York Times coders have been up to  the lesson here is  that unfortunately  Mistakes happen in fact Leo were we to rename this podcast?  It would be mistakes that happened.  Yes, that's the whole show right there.  Yeah, we've seen stories of valuable exposed credentials sitting unnoticed for years, right?  Where like some hacker came along and saw that a credential had been posted publicly,  but nobody noticed it until now.  One real concern for the future against the background of mistakes happen is that there may soon be, if there aren't already,  malicious AI-driven bots scanning and rifling through the internet looking for any fresh mistakes of value that anyone may have made.  The point is, our world is changing right underneath us right now, and I'm not sure  the good guys are winning.  This whole thing feels somewhat asymmetric, right?  Because I mean, as we know, security is about a series of links, and we keep seeming to  add more links to the chain, any one of which, being defective, can break the entire strength  of the chain.  Again, it feels like an asymmetric fight that we are not clearly winning at this point.  Pretty much losing, I think would be fair.  All right, how about this?  You can't recall or recall, recall.  Oh, no.  No, better than that?  I mean, I almost have to do the app just so I can use this name.  It is so good.  Call what?  Okay, I can't wait.  That'll be fun.  Let's take a break, Leo. <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Okay.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> Security Now is brought to you by,<span

So, and I know you'll have something to say about this one,  Leo. During yesterday's Worldwide Developer Conference, or the kickoff, Apple introduced  their forthcoming passwords app. Now of course, Apple users have long been using their iCloud account  to store and sync their passwords among their devices.  But what was going on wasn't super transparent.  No.  It just worked, but without a clear and clean UI, it was necessary to dig down into the  control app to locate a sub-page.  So the passwords app that will be included in the next major release of their OSs, so  So that would be iOS 18, Mac OS Sequoia and Vision OS 2 will provide a UI for Apple's  storage of this information.  Now since this is not ever going to be a cross ecosystem solution, you know, it's Apple  only, those of us, well, yeah, and I've heard you say something about iCloud for Windows  password app.  Anyway, I'll just finish and say that those of us using Windows, Linux or Android will  likely remain with whatever cross ecosystem solution we're using today.  But this move does create an explicit and native password manager for Apple OSs for  the first time.  And if someone is 100% pure Apple world, it likely offers everything anyone would need.  It also incorporates clear pass keys management and a built in one time password style authenticator.  Since I'm currently using OTP off as my one time password authenticator of choice,  you know, I'll look at what Apple has to offer. Once I upgrade my iPhone to something that'll  run iOS 18. I think I'm stuck back on 12 or something right now. But, but so Leo, what is  So I hear that you guys using the word Sherlock.  Where did that come from?  So way back in the day, I mean, I think this is 20 years ago,  there was an app called Sherlock  that let you find files on your device.  It was really good.  You could, you know, you'd make an index  and you'd Sherlock and you could find anything  on your hard drive.  Then Apple released something it calls Spotlight.  And Sherlock was out of business overnight.  And so ever after when Apple introduces a product  that duplicates functionality of a third party product  and essentially puts them out of business,  we call it being Sherlocked.  And there were all, I mean, obviously one password,  Bitwarden and other password managers.  There's a Sherlock festival yesterday.  They may have been Sherlocked by these passwords,  but it was just one of many, exactly, yes.  Now, we've seen Microsoft do the same thing too, right?  Like I was complaining that it took until Service Pack 3  for Windows XP's firewall to be enabled by default.  Back at the time, remember,  zone alarm was my favorite firewall  and there was a firewall industry  for Windows PCs.  And then, well, Microsoft says,  you know, we're gonna put a firewall in,  but don't you worry, it'll be turned off by default.  Well, it eventually got turned on.  And I was just talking to a friend of mine the other day  who was asking me if she needed to be still using MacaFee.  And I said, oh, Lord, no.  I said, you know, Windows built in Defender  is really all anybody needs.  And I explained that Microsoft does this.  They sort of create the capability,  but they don't wanna step on anyone's toes.  So they sort of ease it into the world slowly.  Microsoft, I would argue, is a little less caretaking  about that. They say, yeah, now we're doing that. So, yeah, anyway, again, it makes sense  for this thing to get moved in. So there is no and how iCloud for Windows, how can you  use a password manager for Apple under iCloud for Windows? Because I mean, it's just I thought  it was just folders. Oh, no, no, iCloud for Windows lets you do a lot of things. And including,  I guess now access your passwords. Actually, I think that's been around. It is not as  elegant as a password manager. And remember, this is going to do pass keys.  Right. But I don't know, and they didn't really say, I think the pass keys are hardware dependent,  which means it seems unlikely pass keys would make it over to Windows. But they might do what  they do, what they do now, which is show you a QR code, and then the phone that you have the pass  on you do the QR code. So, you know, is it going to be as full featured as a  standalone password manager? Probably not. That's often the case with these things.  Well, and I'm multi-platform. So, you and I will use it. I can't, I'm Android and  Windows and Linux. Right. But a lot of Apple people, and you know what I love this,  because it means a lot of non-sophisticated users will just do it,  it because it's part of the operating system. It's built in.  Yes, and I think the fact that they're showing it as a separate thing helps to raise people's  awareness of passwords and the various aspects of passwords, like pass keys and one-time passwords  and so forth. It brings it more to light, which has got to be a good thing.  I saw some talk a while back about some congressional pushback on Chinese-made drones by DJI.  Those DJI drones are by far the best drone technology around.  In advance of the U.S. Senate's planned discussion of the so-called Countering CCP Drones Act,  which would limit the use of Chinese made drones in the US on the grounds of national  security.  Tomorrow June 12th DJI will be disabling the ability of users in the US to sync their drone  flight data to its servers and the option to sync US drone data at all will be completely  removed by the end of the month.  So DJI is seeing what's going on with TikTok and this general concern over what the Chinese  Communist Party is doing with technology that US consumers are excited about.  And so I'm sure they don't want to lose this market.  So they're saying, okay, fine, we're going to strip this out of our devices.  So I don't know what a problem that will be for DJI users if being able to sync drone  flight data to servers is a big deal, but it'll be gone by the end of the month.  Okay, another thing that Leo, I think you're going to get a kick out of seeing, although  you and I are not represented among these statistics, slash data revealed some interesting  developers statistics, they recently surveyed 10,000 developers from more than 135 countries.  The question put to them was, quote, how has AI affected your workflow?  Okay, now let me first allow Slash.to introduce themselves.  They wrote, if this is the first time you heard about Slash data, did I say Slash.slash.data?  If this is the first time you've heard about Slash Data, I'm happy to share a few quick  words, writes the person who posted this.  Slash Data is a developer research company.  Every quarter, Slash Data runs a survey on the global developer audience to measure the  pulse of the developer ecosystem and how they feel about new technologies, tools, platforms,  the support from developer programs and more.  the closing of the survey, our expert analysts work to identify key trends and translate  raw data into actionable insights that professionals and companies addressing a developer audience  can utilize to fine-tune their strategy and address developers' needs and wants.  The 26th edition of the Developer Nation survey reached more than 10,000 respondents from  135 countries around the world. Slash Data announces the first two of the six  report series that are coming widely available to the world, showcasing and  dividing into key and diving into key developer trends for 2024 and beyond.  Each report focuses on a specific topic. All reports published under the slate of  the developer nation will be accessible under freshly launched slash data  a research space free access for viewing and downloading.  Okay, so the first two chunks are interesting.  The first is how AI has impacted development.  And the second is the ever popular, which programming language do you use?  So first off, AI.  They said, how developers interact with AI technologies?  Has AI taken over the world?  Not yet, they write.  However, it has already achieved a takeover  of all our discussions about the future, indeed it has.  And they said 59% of developers report  that they're now using AI tools  in their development workflows.  This report investigates the current landscape  of developers work with artificial intelligence,  technologies, and how this impacts their careers.  We start by looking at the ways in which developers work  with machine learning models, tools, APIs, and services,  and highlight the key differences  between professional and amateur developers, and they go on.  So on the AI front, we first have four broad categories.  And Leo, I've got a chart at the top of page nine  show notes. For broad categories, 59% report using AI in their own development work flows.  25% are adding AI functions into applications. And 13% are actively involved in creating AI models.  This leaves only 29% whose development work has not yet been touched by AI in any of those ways.  Wow. So, yeah, among the 59%, so more than half and fewer than two-thirds. And I'm in  that category, by the way. I have an AI that helps me with my coding. Yes, yes. So 59% who  are now actively using AI tools in their development workflows, 42%, almost half, are using chat  bots to obtain answers to coding questions. This is globally out of more than 10,000 developers  surveyed, 42% are using chatbots to obtain answers to coding questions, 27% are using  development tools that have AI assistance built in, and 19 are using generative AI to  help generate creative assets. If coding was a Monday through Friday 9 to 5 job, which  I was doing to earn my living, where I was being judged by my own productivity against  my peers, then yeah, I'd be quite happy to get quick answers to questions about how to  do this or that from a chatbot AI. You know, rather than searching around the Internet,  looking for someone like, like, you know, wherever on the internet, StacExchange is  the name I was just trying to remember.  StacExchange, who has posted something similar to learn from, I'd be happy to ask a smart  bot, you know, what it had found from previously doing essentially the same thing.  There's no shame there and it's clear that many coders agree.  I use it instead of flipping through manuals.  Yes.  Almost universally, the stuff that's on Stack Exchange is useless, but I still have to,  I mean, I don't code enough to remember every, and the language I use is massive, common  list.  So this isn't in lieu of looking through manuals.  It's very useful.  Yep.  Very useful.  Yep.  So, so what's going on with the use of programming languages?  I have a chart there at the bottom of page nine the survey revealed that by far  The number one language in use today  Is JavaScript? Oh, yeah, that's for sure. Yep web web programming the current total is estimated to be  25.2 million  JavaScript coders Wow  with that number having grown by 4 million just over the past year.  So, 25.2 million JavaScript coders in the number two slot is Python at 18.2 million.  There's probably a lot of overlap too. I mean, nobody uses just one language.  Right.  Yeah, right. Python at 18.2 million, which is just a bit ahead of Java at 17.7 million  in third place. Behind those top three is C++ at 11.6, C-sharp at 10.2, PHP at a respectable  9.8 million visual development tools at 7.2 million followed by plain old C  language at 6.5. Then in steadily decreasing numbers we have Kotlin, Go,  Swift, Rust, Dart, Objective C, Ruby, and Lua. And you know Leo there's no sign of  of Lisp or Assembly language on this chart.  World timers.  What do you suppose that means?  That neither of the two languages  which you and I have chosen to use,  Lisp and Assembler respectively, are in the running here.  We're just smarter than the masses.  That's all there is to it.  I think part of it is that we're able to choose  the language we most want to code in.  That's right.  We don't have any boss telling us  or an existing code base that we're having to maintain  in whatever language.  Or colleagues who are able to read our code.  Right, yes.  And neither of us are part of a team  that would think we had lost our minds.  But I also, there are very good modern languages  that are on that list either.  I think it really comes down to more trends,  but also what your business is demanding of you.  Yes, I think, I mean,  I mean, for, we already know for decades, coders resumes have listed all the languages that  they can, you know, that they're proficient in.  Right.  So, it's certainly-  Any coders should be able to write in any language if they're any good.  Right.  I mean, it's-  Or be able to pick up a new one if they're good.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  You can, yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  All the concepts are the same.  And that's where a, you know, a chat bot can help you.  Helps a lot.  It's like, okay.  That's right.  You know, I'm not proficient in pearl, but I need to solve a pearl problem.  So what regex would you expect to use?  I've actually done that.  And it may not be right, but it's a place to start.  It's a good start.  I've taken some Python code that I didn't fully understand, given it to chat GPT, and  said, what would this look like in Lisp?  And yeah, it wasn't perfect, but it gave me a big head start on understanding what that  code was doing.  So the question is, are we going to turn programming over to AIs?  No.  Well, coding appears to be something that AIs may be able to do.  And it makes a sort of sense for code to be something that an AI might do well, because  after all, it's talking to a machine.  So that begs the question, what's going on at the university level with computer science  education?  Insider published a piece last Monday titled, with AI writing so much code,  should you still study computer science? And the subheading was,  this new data point provides an answer. Now I realize that many of our listeners  are well past university age, but many will have children or perhaps grandchildren  who may be wondering whether coding has been lost to AI.  So the author of this piece writes,  one of the most persistent concerns around generative AI  is whether the technology will put workers out of a job.  This idea has particularly caught on  in the context of software coding.  GitHub co-pilot can write a lot of code these days.  So is it even worth studying computer science now?  That's been a question on the minds of math minded high schoolers since chat  GPT burst onto the scene in 2022.  There's a new data point that helps answer at least part of this question.  Students are still lining up in droves to take computer  science in college.  Let's take the University of California, Berkeley as an example,  as this college is at or near the top for computer science.  as it was when I was there in 73. First year applications to UC Berkeley's College of Computing,  Data Science, and Society, CDSS. Now that's not the college I was in. I was in WECS,  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but we have CDSS, the College of Computing,  Data Science, and Society. Anyway, first year applications increased 48% this year.  There were 14,302 non-transfer applications for these CDSS majors in the fall of 2024,  incoming class versus 9,649 the previous year.  So in one year, 48% increase.  They said for, whereas for context, the number of first year applications to UC Berkeley  as a whole did not change much from a year earlier. So specifically the College of Computing  Data Science and Society. This was announced last week by Professor Jennifer Chase, the  Dean of Berkeley's College of CDSS during the Joint California Summit on Generative  AI in San Francisco. Afterwards, Business Insider got in touch with an interesting  guy, John DeNiro, a computer science teaching professor at UC Berkeley to talk about this  some more.  Now, he's also chief scientist at Lilt, a generative AI startup, and he was previously  a researcher at Google working on Google Translate, one of the first successful AI-powered  consumer apps.  Okay, so at this point in the article quotes this John DeNarrow guy.  And remember, he's a teaching professor of computer science at UC Berkeley who's been  working with AI at Google and is now the chief scientist at a generative AI startup.  So the article continues.  In an email to Business Insider, John wrote, students quotes, so this is John speaking,  Students expressed some concern that generative AI will affect the software engineering job  market, especially for entry-level positions, but they're still excited about careers in  computing.  I tell them that I think many of the challenging aspects of software development cannot be  performed reliably by generative AI at this point, and that I expect there will still  be a central role for human software developers long into the future.  So this is a compsci professor, teaching professor at Merkley who's also deeply steeped in AI  technology.  The article says, DaNero explained that generative AI is currently very good at replicating parts  of software programs that have been written many times before.  But what if you want to create something new?  This is where smart human coders will still be needed.  This makes logical sense as AI models are trained on data.  If that information doesn't exist yet, or it's not part of the training dataset, the  models often get in trouble.  Or as we say, they just make it up.  De Nero said, quote, Generative AI requires a lot of thoughtful human intervention to  produce something new, and all consequential software development projects involve quite  a bit of novelty.  That's the hard and interesting part of computing that currently requires clever and well-trained  people.  Generative AI can speed up the more mundane parts of software development, and software  developers tend to adopt efficiency tools quickly."  So this applies to what's happening at Lilt, which is building an AI platform for translators.  Google Translate first came out 18 years ago, they write, and human linguists still have  jobs and are relied upon when translations are really important.  For instance, you could use Google Translate to read a Japanese train timetable, but would  Would you use the app to translate your business's most important contract without having a human  expert check it out?  Probably not.  John said, quote, to reliably produce publication quality translations, human expert linguists  are still at the center of the process.  But by using LILTS task-specific generative AI models, those experts are much faster,  more accurate, and more consistent.  As a result, more text gets translated at higher quality into more languages."  And they finish, he expects the same pattern to play out in software development.  A small team of highly trained human developers will have an even greater capacity to build  useful high quality software.  DeNarrow finished by adding, and so, future Berkeley graduates will have plenty of opportunities  to use their computing skills to improve the world. Hopefully, some more of them will come  to work at Lilt. And I've got to kick out of that because where better to recruit people  for your own startup? Your classes.  Then being, yes, then teaching them and, you know, calling from the herd, those that you  to have working for you. And Leo, it really does make sense. You know, I, I'm weird,  right? I mean, we already know I code an assembly language. At the moment, I am creating the  scaffolding to access calm API objects in my email server from assembly language.  Oh, that sounds painful.  Because it is unbelievably painful.  There would be absolutely libraries galore to do that in any higher level language.  And there are none.  No one, as far as I know, has not been done in Assembler.  But I like it.  And I also spend a lot of...  You like it.  Yes, I like it.  And how many times have I written a super fast sword algorithm of one type or another?  I've written them and I've rewritten them because I like it. It's like somebody who  loves like a woodworker building chairs. It's like I'm going to make the next chair  I build is going to be better than the last one. But I'm coding because I want to, not  because I have to. So it totally makes sense to me that generative AI could be producing  a bunch of the crap code that is has that people have already written not the new stuff,  which is where the fun really is for most people who, you know, don't like building  chairs over and over. You can always buy a chair, but there's a satisfaction in building  your own. Absolutely. Yeah. And I would imagine anybody who's in a computer science program.  I would hope is there because they enjoy it because they like it. They're not just there  to get a job skill. I mean, that's a nice side benefit.  It certainly is nice to be able to spend your life doing something new.  Do something you love. You'll be glad.  Okay, so, and this one affects you, Leo, as a Linux person. In case any of our Linux users  notice and worry about a sudden torrent of CVEs emanating from the Linux kernel project,  I wanted to assure everyone that the problem is with the underlying issuing policies and  is not reflective of any sudden collapse of the Linux's kernel code quality.  Catalin Simpanu, the editor of the Risky Business Newsletter, did some editorializing, but he  He drew the facts underlying his recent editorial from across the industry.  So this is strongly based in what everybody who's looking at this going, what the hell  is going on is talking about.  So I'm explaining this beforehand since I wanted everyone to understand that this is  not just one grumpy guy's opinion.  Here's what he wrote last Wednesday.  She said in February of this year, the Linux kernel project was made an official CVE numbering  authority, that's called a CNA, a CVE numbering authority, with exclusive rights to issue  CVE identifiers for the Linux kernel.  Now initially this looked like good news, he wrote.  Almost three months later, this has turned into a complete and utter disaster.  Over the past months, the Linux kernel team has issued thousands of CVE identifiers, with  the vast majority being for trivial bug fixes and not just security flaws.  In May alone, according to Cisco's Jerry Gambling, the Linux team issued over 1,100 CVEs, a  number that easily beat out professional bug bounty programs and platforms run by the likes  of Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, WordFence, and PatchStack.  Ironically, he says, this was a disaster waiting to happen, with the Linux team laying out  some weird rules for issuing CVEs right from the moment it received its CNA status.  We say weird because they're quite unique among all CNAs.  The Linux kernel team argues that because of the deep layer where the kernel runs, bugs  are hard to understand, and there's always a possibility of them becoming a security  issue later down the line.  He said, direct quote below, quote, this is the Linux kernel team, note, due to the layer  at which the Linux kernel is in a system, almost any bug might be exploitable to compromise  the security of the kernel.  But the possibility of exploitation is often not evident when the bug is fixed.  Because of this, the CVE assignment team is overly cautious and assigns CVE numbers to  any bug fix that they identify.  This explains the seemingly large number of CVEs that are issued by the Linux kernel  team.  Wow.  He says, while this looks good on paper, the reality is that other projects also manage  similarly sensitive projects, but they don't issue CVEs for literally every possible bug  fix.  You don't see Intel and AMD issuing hundreds of CVEs with each firmware update.  These projects vet reports to confirm that bugs pose a security risk before issuing  a CVE and triggering responses with their customers, such as inventory asset scans and emergency  patch deployments.  In other words, CVEs have actual real world consequences.  They're not just to be used casually.  He says instead, the Linux kernel team appears to have adopted a simpler approach where it  puts a CVE on everything and lets the software and info security community at large confirm  whether or not an issue is an authentic security flaw.  If it's not, it's then up to the security and vulnerability management firms to file  CVE revocation requests with the Linux kernel team that's responsible for the affected component.  Linux's new CNA rules also prohibit the issuance of CVE for bugs in EOL Linux kernels.  turning me into a hollow man all shit. I'm sorry. For bugs in EOL Linux kernels, which  is also another weird take on security. He said, just because you don't maintain the  code anymore, doesn't mean attackers won't exploit it and that people wouldn't want to  track it. The Linux team will also refuse to assign CVEs until a patch has been deployed,  meaning there will be no CVEs for zero days or vulnerabilities that may require a longer  reporting and patching timeline.  I think they do not know what CVE means.  Leo, that's nuts. I mean, it's like if we don't admit that there's a problem, then  Then Google can't start a clock forcing us to fix it.  So we're not going to issue it for a zero day or vulnerabilities that may take a while  to fix.  I mean, you're right.  It's like they don't at all understand what CVEs are for.  Adelman said, the new rules also create a confusing process of validating, contesting,  and rejecting CVEs.  I'm not going to go into all of that, he said, since the venerable Brian Martin did  a way better job back in February.  Open source securities Bradley Spangler shared a real world example last week of why the  entire process of analyzing, validating, and revoking Linux CVEs is now a giant cluster F,  you know what, of confusion and frustration. Catalan said, we quote him, quote, to say this is a  complete disaster is an understatement. This is why CVEs should be for vulnerabilities,  should involve actual analysis and should provide that information in the CVE description  as any other responsible CNA would be doing."  Catelyn said, Linux maintainer Greg Crow Hartman tried to justify the team's approach to its  new CVE rules, but as expected this has not gone down well with those in the InfoSec community.  Criticism has been levied against the Linux kernel team from everywhere.  And there have been some calls for the Linux team to reconsider their approach to issuing CVEs.  The new rules were criticized right from the get-go. The likes of Katie Moussaurus, Valentina  Pomeati, Ian Coldwater, Bradley Spengler again and again, Adam Schall, Tiberius, the GR  security team, the Graphene OS team and a whole bunch more foresaw the disaster that  is currently unfolding.  And if this isn't bad enough, the Linux kernel team appears to be backfilling CVEs for fixes  to last year's code, generating even more noise for people who use CVEs for legitimate  purposes. Some describe the Linux team's approach as malicious compliance. After the project  was criticized for years for downplaying vulnerability reports and contesting CVEs assigned to its  code by other CNAs. This may not be the case as the new approach has some fans who see its merits,  such as forcing more people to upgrade their kernels on a more regular basis, meaning even  if it's not necessary. Quote, the Linux CNA, this is quoting somebody, he doesn't say who,  the Linux CNA intentionally adopts an overly cautious approach and assigns a new CVE when in doubt.  While this may surprise many, it is a perfectly legitimate and entirely honest strategy.  In contrast, vendors of proprietary software often tend to take the opposite approach,  minimizing the assignment of CVEs whenever possible. Effectively, managing  the substantial number of CVEs involves understanding your kernel configuration,  having a clear threat model, and ensuring the ability to update the kernel as  needed. I hope that other large projects will eventually adopt Linux's approach."  And Catalan finishes, unfortunately, all of this CVE spam could not have happened at a  worse time.  Just as the Linux kernel team was getting its CNA status, NIST, you know, NIST was slowing  down its management of the NVD database where all CVEs are compiled and enriched.  cited a staff shortage and a sudden rise in the number of reported vulnerabilities,  mainly from the IoT space. Having one of every fifth CVE being a Linux non-security  bug is not helping NIST at all right now.  So unfortunately, we depend upon CVEs to convey true problems that require remediation of  some kind.  Having the Linux kernel project spewing CVEs for non-vulnerability bugs really is an abuse  of the system.  And they're creating a lot of noise, which is obscuring the real security.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It has a real potential of just causing people.  It's crying wolf.  Right.  You're going to end up blunting the effect.

So, uh,  GRC's email system continues to mature and I could not be more pleased with my  decision to create a more convenient means for our listeners to send podcast  feedback.  Some listeners have noted that nowhere on GRC's website do I prominently display the email address,  securitynowatgrc.com.  That's true and that's also deliberate.  It's clearly not a secret, since Leo and I will be mentioning it every week here.  but to whatever degree is possible, I'd like to reserve inbound email to that mailbox for  podcast feedback. There will be a temptation to send things to me that I already pay Sue  and Greg to handle. So I'd prefer not to short circuit our traditional lines of communication.  So once again, security now at GRC.com and I imagine everybody can remember that. I did  want to let everyone know that after last week's podcast, I improved GRC's email registration  system to also accept email that's registered against a user's from header.  The moment I made that change, all false positive rejections stopped. We haven't had a single  one since then. So anyone who may have had initial difficulty registering with private  domains fronted by Gmail or some other email anonymization service should no  longer have any trouble and may do so. So again, I was a little overprotective  initially. That's fixed. It's easier now. Several people have been worried that they  haven't ever received a single piece of email from me. They're expecting, you  know, they're expecting the flow of weekly podcast announcements. So I wanted to  assure everyone that so far I have never sent one. I'm still working to finish up  the front-end email registration bounce processing, which I expect to complete  this week. I always wondered about the practice of asking people to enter their  email addresses twice. I understood that it was to catch typos, and when I  designed GRC's e-commerce system back in 2003, that's what I had it do too.  But I did that mostly because everyone at the time was doing it.  Now I know why.  The email registration system I have does not do that.  And it's somewhat surprising to see how many typos are present in email that cannot be  delivered.  It turns out that dot-vom is not a valid top-level domain, and that the v key is right next to  the c key.  The good news is that such typos only result in a brief stumble since this is part of an  immediate email confirmation loop.  So anyone who doesn't receive a confirmation email returns to try again, and they will  probably enter their email correctly and maybe by typing it more carefully the second time.  Since I think that asking everyone only once because they receive immediate confirmation  is more convenient for most people, I'm going to leave the system as it is.  I'm not going to ask everybody to enter it twice.  The work I'm doing right now is in automating the process of receiving any immediate delivery  attempt failures from our email server and holding that information for someone's second  attempt when they don't get the first email confirmation and then come back and try again.  There are a surprising number of mailbox unknown or mailbox over quota bounce backs  that I would like to be able to present to someone when they retry using an address that  just failed for that reason. So once that system is in place, I'll actually begin sending email  and the system will be up and running. Okay, so I got a kick out of this fictional dialogue  with an AI, which was titled Ordering a Pizza in 2024. This was shared by a listener via Twitter.  There's no indication of the dialogue's origin, but it's definitely worth sharing.  So, the caller, the caller says apparently in another phone, is this Pizza Hut?  No sir, it's Google Pizza.  Caller, oh, I must have dialed the wrong number, sorry.  No sir, Google bought Pizza Hut last month.  Okay, I would like to order a pizza.  Do you want your usual sir?  My usual?  You know me?  According to our caller ID datasheet, the last 12 times you called, you ordered an extra  large pizza with three cheeses, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and meatballs on a thick  crust.  The caller says, Super!  That's what I'll have.  Google, may I suggest that this time you order a pizza with ricotta, arugula, sun-dried  tomatoes, and olives on a whole wheat gluten-free thin crust?  The caller says, What?  I don't want a vegetarian pizza!  Google, your cholesterol is not good, sir. How the hell do you know that?  Well, we cross-referenced your home phone number with your medical records. We  have the result of your blood tests for the last seven years.  Uh, okay, but I do not want your rotten vegetarian pizza. I already take  medication for my cholesterol. Oh, excuse me, sir, but you've not taken your  medication regularly. According to our database, you purchased only a box of  30 cholesterol tablets once at Lloyd's pharmacy four months ago."  Caller says, I bought more from another pharmacy.  That doesn't show on your credit card statement.  I paid in cash, but you did not withdraw enough cash according to your bank statement.  I have other sources of cash.  That doesn't show on your latest tax returns unless you bought them using an unclear, undeclared  income source, which of course is against the law.  The caller says, what the heck?  Google says, I'm sorry sir, we use such information only with the sole intention of helping you.  The caller says, enough already.  I'm sick of Google, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and all the others.  I'm going to an island without the internet, TV, where there's no phone service and no  one to watch me or spy on me.  Google says, I understand sir, but you need to renew your passport first.  It expired six weeks ago.  So anyway, yes.  If Microsoft Recall does evolve into a semi-smart personal assistant, it better not start offering  helpful advice.  Or maybe people will think about deleting it.  Or using my forthcoming freeware app.  We'll see.  And all recall.  Nathan.  I keep trying.  Nathan.  Oh, Leo.  Like I said, I'll just make sure you don't have a mouth full of coffee.  Nathan Hartley tweeted, I would love Windows Copilot on my work PC, though we have far  more local admins who have access to everything that I'm comfortable with.  I will wait a bit for my personal PC.  Now, of course, Nathan is suggesting that in a corporate environment, having access  to a comprehensive history of everything that has been done on a company machine might be  useful. But he wonders what access to that information would also be available to local  admins. And I think that's another very good point. All indications are that in their enthusiasm  for this idea, which is understandable, Microsoft failed to give sufficient thought to just how  transformative a change it would be for a machine's entire usage history to be  captured and stored in detail. We know that enterprise machines are owned and  operated by their companies who oversee them in their security. So how does  Recall fit into that environment? There do appear to be some questions still to  be answered. Tom whose Tom Lawrence Tech, this was shared via a public tweet, so it  appeared in my timeline because he referenced at SGGRC. He said, I just had a great conversation  with at DR The Nerd about Adam Network, PF Sense, and their Don't Talk to Strangers system.  He said, I'll be doing some testing, but for those who want to learn more right now, check  out htdps slash slash adamnet.works and at SGGRC episode 946.  He provided a link.  Now, of course, DR the nerd, that would be David Reddicop, whom I first met when they <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> were an early advertiser on this podcast, I think right from the get go, Leo, with the<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> Canada based nerds on site guys at the time.

And noted that<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> they have some very interesting and very mature perimeter security technology, which definitely<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> worth looking at. Okay. Listener John Liptak asked Steve, I've been caught up in Google<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span>  domains in the Google domains to Squarespace DNS migration.  And due to Squarespace's terms of service, I want to move.  However, due to the number of security issues with DNS, as well as your wonderful testing  software, I've been unable to find the episode where you give your recommendation for a domain  name provider.  Can you remind me who you recommend?  Thanks, John.  The name John is trying to recall is hover.com. <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> They are my absolute hands down favorite domain name registrar.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> They were also a Twits sponsor, though that followed my switching to them away from network<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> solutions who is GRC's original registrar, with whom I registered the GRC.com domain<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> back in December of 1991, which was a few months after the domain Microsoft.com was first registered.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span>  I could not be more pleased and happy and happy to recommend Hover as the place for anyone to  hang their domain. Again, I know that Leo, you and I both have a ridiculous number of domains  just because each one seems inexpensive and maybe we'll use it someday for something.  I can't even tell you like the nonsense I have, but what the heck?  They're all there at hover.  Steve in Tampa, Florida sent me a note regarding the token two keys that we've talked about  a couple times.  He said, I just want to let you know that after hearing your mention of the token two  keys on the podcast, I ordered two of the T2F2 NFC dual keys. I received them  today. I immediately downloaded the Windows app from their website and  entered in a pin. I then tried them with Bitwarden. After entering them in  Bitwarden under web-authent, I was able to, in other words, the  past keys, I was able to log in in every case, USB-A, USB-C, and NFC, using either the web  app or an Android phone. Of note is that to activate the key, you need to squeeze contacts  together and not just touch the contacts, regards Steve in Tampa, Florida. So that's  welcome feedback and I'm glad they were that those token two keys were not a boondoggle.  They really do look like solid solutions.  The ones I ordered were back ordered  and they've not shown up yet, but I'm not in a huge hurry.  Now, yesterday, a listener, Bob Grant,  wrote, through the new email system,  with some of the best on-the-ground feedback  about the current state of pass keys support  that I've seen so far.  What Bob had to share was of crucial importance  because it clearly dispels the belief that all websites  which support pass keys, support multiple pass keys,  thereby allowing multiple physical dongles  to be used without restriction.  That's not the case.  So here's Bob's great reporting.  He said, hi, Steve.  I've always enjoyed trying out the bleeding edge,  and I've been using Yuba keys for over a decade,  So I recently replaced one of my Yuba keys with a token two key for  Switzerland to get its 100 passkey support.  I then went about registering multiple Yuba keys and my new token two keys plus  Bidwarden at multiple sites. For instance,  I have five Gmail accounts and two Microsoft accounts.  I wanted to use with the passkeys.  I discovered a few indications that we have a ways to go before this is ready or easy for prime time.  For security purposes, all the hardware keys require a pin to unlock the key for each login to a site.  This is as opposed to Bidwarden, which will do it for you while the vault is unlocked,  or if locked, can use a biometric authentication which is pretty quick.  Further, the hardware token operation requires an initial touch to bring up the pin prompt  followed by another touch after the pin to perform the authentication.  The token two keys require the FIDO recommended six-digit PIN, whereas Yuba keys allow for  a more convenient four-digit PIN.  As usual, security trumps convenience.  Next, I found that a bunch of sites do not follow the FIDO recommendations.  eBay, PayPal, and Lowe's only allow a single pass key to be registered.  This of course means you have to use something like Bitwarden that can sync between devices  rather than a single hardware key, which is a point of failure.  Kayak, LinkedIn, Adobe, and Amazon do not allow naming the keys as you enroll them.  in, calls them passkey123, etc.  Amazon has the date, but not the time the key was enrolled.  So there's no way to differentiate unless you enroll on different days.  The effect of this is that if you need to revoke a key that is lost, you don't know  which enrolled key you should be deleted from the site.  All other sites I used allowed naming at creation and some even allow later renaming of enrolled  keys.  Most sites allow quite a few keys, but LinkedIn only allows five.  Surprisingly, Amazon AWS seems to only allow FIDO1 style U2F mode keys, not FIDO2, for  passkey login.  Many sites allow keys from one type of device, for example iOS or iPadOS, but not from another,  like Firefox on a desktop.  Chrome seems to have better support, and I think MS Edge has good support although I  didn't test extensively.  Chrome allows managing keys, you know, token 2 or Yuba key, from its settings security menu  within the browser.  So you can list, delete, edit, etc.  This all suggests that it's still early days, but I still kind of prefer my Yuba key to  my Token 2 key and I'm doubtful I'll get to 100 pass keys anytime soon.  The Token 2 is fatter and more bulky and at least feels a little more vulnerable than  the Yuba key.  Also at one point my T2 stopped responding and prompting for a pin when I tried to log  in.  I was able to use my Yuba keys without a problem.  Once I rebooted my laptop, the Token 2 key resumed responding.  I don't know whether the auth infrastructure would blacklist a key, but I'm going to keep  an eye on it.  Now, for the record, my guess is that the Token 2 Windows app probably froze somehow  and that that's what the reboot cured.  And of course, you know, USB is always because it came along after Windows had already launched  and a lot of it been written, USB has always been a little bit flaky.  So anyway, he finishes, I'd like to see PayPal allow multiple keys so I could switch to using  a hardware key for added security, but I'll need to use Bitwarden with PayPal until then.  It's disappointing to me that banks, investment houses and other high value targets do not  currently support pass keys at all.  In fact, most are still using SMS text second factors rather than Google Auth or even the  older U2F which could use keys for multiple factor authentication.  Hardware keys can also be used for SSH authentication for more security for your SSH sessions.  Each one takes the same type of slot as a pass key and can also store the SSH key info  which allows it to move the public key from system to system. It's easy to see  what an uphill battle squirrel faced when even given all the support behind Fido2,  its implementation remains spotty and uncertain. So wow, thank you very much, Bob. That's some  terrific feedback about the current state of past key support. And all of this does suggest  that today's optimal solution, driven by the fact that there are sites which will only accept a  single passkey enrollment would be, and you never know when you're going to hit one, would be to  enroll one or more where possible hardware dongles only for the highest security sites where that's  what you want. But to then otherwise use a cross-platform password manager such as Bitwarden,  a sponsor of the TWIT network, and use that hardware dongle to in turn unlock Bitwarden  if you want more than Bitwarden's biometric unlocking. In that fashion, any site's single  Paskey support won't present a problem since Bitwarden is able to present that site single  Paskey from any Bitwarden supported device. And now that its support for mobile devices <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> is shipping, it's on all platforms everywhere. A listener using his initials BE surprised<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-detected ad-tooltip"> me. He wrote, Hi Steve, thank you for the new email system since I don't use any social<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o</span></span>  media regarding code signing HSMs.  My friend and I are on top of the development of a hobby  software used by only 15 to 20 people.  We used to share the code signing keys between us and one other developer.  But when I went to renew the code signing certificate,  I saw there is no longer an option to be able to sign any code without an HSM.  Do you have any idea how we can still have the three developers able to sign the code?  Thank you for all your work, longtime listener, and a club-tweet member, B.  Yay!  Thank you.  Okay.  So, this was news to me.  In a follow-up note, BE sent some links so that I didn't need to track them down myself.  And sure enough, reading from the Knowledge Base maintained by my favorite certificate  authority, DigiSert, under the title, New Private Key Storage Requirement for Code Signing  Certificates, they write, Starting on June 1, 2023, industry standards will require  private keys for standard code signing certificates to be stored on hardware certified as FIPS  140 Level 2 common criteria EAL4 plus or equivalent. In other words, an HSM, some sort of a hardware  dongle. This change, they write, strengthens private key protection for code signing certificates  and allows and aligns it with EV extended validation code  signing certificate private key protection.  Wow. This is actually troubling.  First, as I previously reported, the enhanced trust that  Microsoft was originally conveying to any code signed with  this significantly more expensive EV certs, which have  always required storage in an HSM has been revoked so that there is no longer any benefit  to having an EV certificate for code signing.  No one cares.  But now the industry has moved to requiring all code signing to be performed inside and  by a hardware dongle.  It was already a problem that any code signing was becoming a requirement, which is what  we've been seeing due to the increasing prevalence of malicious code.  The problem is that many open source projects are hobby projects like that of our listener,  which would otherwise not need to be signed.  So this general signing requirement was already imposing a burden on developers, but now the  The stakes are raised even higher, requiring the purchase of hardware for the storage of  any code signing key.  And as a side effect, as our listener notes, this also prevents small teams of hobby developers  from sharing a single certificate among themselves for the purpose of defraying and amortizing  its cost across multiple users.  That's not as if this is a one-time event since certifier  expire and require periodic renewal.  The hardware won't need renewing,  but an updated certificate will need to be installed.  So what I expect will happen  is it will start to begin seeing code signing surfers  appearing so that multiple members of a team  distributed physically, geographically, will still be able to share a single HSM  dongle among themselves. And when that happens, I sure hope they get their  security right, since there will be tremendous pressure from malware authors  to also get their malicious software signed by those same code signing  servers. Now as we know, I wrote such a thing myself as part of Spinrite 6-1's  launch, since everyone's Spinrite download is unique and needs to be  individually signed. And I commented here a few months ago when we learned that  EV certs were losing their special treatment that I had apparently wasted  my time doing that because my next certificate would not be EV and would  therefore not need to be contained within an HSM. It turns out my time was not  wasted after all. Everyone who signs code will need to use an HSM to do so as  soon as their current non-HSM code signing certificate expired. Wow! Yet  another tax put on the good guys by malware. That's it's unfortunate and  And again, it is there's certainly nothing prevents anyone from automating the code signing process.  As I found due to Microsoft's pathetic documentation for doing this, for me, it was a heavy lift.  I got it working. It's been surprisingly, which is to say utterly bulletproof since I finally finished it.  and I'm thankful for that, but boy, I'm sure somebody will do it for Linux and open source it,  and then code signing servers will be something we start to see. And for what it's worth, BE, <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> it is possible to rekey a certificate for installation in a second hardware dongle.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> So if you ended up purchasing two dongles, one for each location, you could still only purchase one certificate key.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> The process of installing it does not give you any control over it.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> This is by design, so that it can only get installed in a single device.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> but it can be immediately rekeyed and then installed into a second device.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> So at least you won't need to be doubling up on purchases if you have two sets of hardware,</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> but boy, it's very clear this is what the industry has done and it's gonna, you know,</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> it's a tax on open source software and I think it's really unfortunate Leo.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> Yeah, I agree. 100%.

Microsoft.com?  So the page I ran across at Microsoft,  and I don't recall how it came to my attention,  has the intriguing title,  examining the deception infrastructure in place behind code.microsoft.com.  Okay, what the deception infrastructure? What? Well, it turns out that the reader is not  left to wonder long since this piece starts out, quote, the domain name code.microsoft.com  has an interesting story behind it.  Today, it's not linked to anything,  but that wasn't always true.  And as a matter of fact, yesterday I did an NS lookup  and the domain and there's no name resolution.  So they completely disconnected it.  He writes, this is the story of one of my most successful  Honeypot instances and how it enabled Microsoft  to collect varied threat intelligence  against a broad range of actor groups targeting Microsoft.  I'm writing this now as we've decided  to retire this capability.  Okay, now that's not the good part.  This astonishing part is how this got started.  So here's what he wrote.  Code.Microsoft.com was an early domain  used to host Visual Studio Code  and some helpful documentation.  The domain was active until around 2021,  when this documentation was moved to a new home.  After the move, the site behind the domain  was an Azure App Service site  that performed redirection,  thus preventing existing links from being broken.  Then sometime around mid-2021,  the existing Azure App Service instance was shut down,  leaving code.microsoft.com pointing to a service that no longer existed.  This created a vulnerability.  This situation is what's called a dangling subdomain,  which refers to, which as far as I know, Microsoft just made up.  Never heard that before. A dangling subdomain,  which refers to a subdomain that once pointed to a valid resource,  but now hangs in limbo. Again,  limbo is not a term. That's something you normally do where you have to  just like lean over backwards and get underneath of horizontal bar.  I don't know, you know, limbo, okay? So he says, imagine a subdomain  like blog.subdomain.com that's used to handle a blog application.  When the underlying service is deleted,  the blog engine, you might update your page link and assume the service has been retired.  However, there is still a subdomain pointing to the blog.  What? This is now dangling and cannot be resolved. Okay? He says a malicious actor  can discover the dangling subdomain. Except no, it's a subdomain of your own domain.  So a malicious actor, what do you mean they can discover it?  Anyway, he says,  I'm malicious. This is what he said.  A malicious actor can discover the dangling subdomain provision a cloud  Azure resource with the same name and now visiting blog.  Some some domain dot com will redirect to the attackers resource.  What?  He says, now they control the content.  He says, this happened in 2021 when the domain was temporarily used to host a malware command  and control service.  Thanks to multiple reports from our great community, this was quickly spotted and taken  down before it could be used.  a response to this, Microsoft now has more robust tools in place to catch similar threats.  Okay, so first of all, let me just say, holy crap!  And I hope that no one listening to this while driving just lost control of their vehicle,  because this is nothing short of insane, that that could happen.  I'm not trained up on Azure and on how or why it might be possible for a so-called  dangling subdomain of Microsoft.com to be casually commandeered by someone not Microsoft  by giving their own Azure cloud instance the same name as an unassigned Microsoft subdomain.  All I can surmise is that there must be some serious architectural design  problems over in Microsoft land for that to ever have been possible. That's just  nuts. But at any event, this author continues by posting the rhetorical  question, how did it become a honeypot? He says today it's revel it's relatively  routine for MSTIC to take control of an attacker controlled resource and repurpose these for  threat intelligence collection, right? Like, you know, they'll take over some domain that was an  existing command and control server and run it in order to, you know, gain intelligence. He wrote,  taking control of a malware command and control environment, for example,  enables us to potentially discover new infected nodes.  Right. In other words,  because the infected machines will be phoning home to the mothership for  instructions.  So he says at the time of the dangling code,  you know, code.microsoft.com subdomain,  he says this process was relatively new.  We wanted a good test case to show the value of taking over resources versus taking them down.  So instead of removing the dangling subdomain, we pointed it instead to a node in our existing vast Honeypot sensor network.  He says, and just for anyone who doesn't know, but everyone does,  a Honeypot is a decoy system designed to attract and monitor malicious activity.  Honeypots can be used to collect information about the attackers, their tools, their techniques, and their intentions.  Honeypots can also be used to divert the attackers from the real targets to consume and waste their time and resources.  Microsoft's Honeypot Sensor Network has been in development since 2018.  It's used to collect information on emerging threats to both our and our customers' environments.  The data we collect helps us be better informed when a new vulnerability is disclosed  and gives us retrospective information on how, when, and where exploits are developed.  This data becomes enriched with other tools Microsoft has available,  turning it from a source of raw threat data into threat intelligence.  This is then incorporated into a variety of our security products.  Customers can also get access to this via Sentinel's emerging threat feed.  feed. The Honeypot itself is a custom designed framework written in C-sharp.  It enables security researchers to quickly deploy anything from a single HTTP exploit handler in  one or two lines of code all the way up to complex protocols like SSH and VNC.  For even more complex protocols, we can hand off incoming connections to real systems when  we detect exploit traffic and revert these shortly after.  It is our mission to deny threat actors access to resources or enable them to use our infrastructure  to create further victims.  That's why in almost all scenarios the attacker is playing in a high interaction simulated  environment.  No code is run.  Everything is a trick or deception designed to get them to reveal their intentions.  Substantial engineering has gone into our simulation framework.  Today, get this, over 300 pseudo vulnerabilities can be triggered through the same exploit  proof of concepts available in places like GitHub and exploit DB.  Thread actors can communicate with over 30 different protocols and can even log in and  deploy scripts and execute payloads that look like they're operating on a real system.  There is no real system and almost everything is being simulated.  Okay, so, wow, let me just say props where it's due and it's definitely due here.  That is some seriously cool technology.  created the matrix. A simulated deliberately vulnerable environment that's  designed to lure bad guys into believing that they've successfully exploited  any of more than 300 known vulnerabilities on a machine while retaining  the control that the actual exploitation of the vulnerability was designed to  bypass. So it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck but it ain't no duck.  Very, very cool tech. So he continues, it's impossible that in standing up a honey pot  on an important domain like Microsoft.com, it wasn't possible for attackers to use this as an  environment to perform other web attacks. Attacks that might rely on same  origin trust, meaning they had to make sure that bad guys could not originate  their attacks from inside Microsoft.com because that's where code.Microsoft.com  was. You can imagine that you know everybody knows what Microsoft.com  networks are and it would not be a stretch to imagine that there are some enterprises  that have white listed Microsoft networks after having to put lots of individual white  list IPs.  Some guy just said, oh forget it, let's just white list the whole, you know, slash 16 or  you know, whatever Microsoft has.  So he said, so again, origin of trust, they could not allow the origin to be Microsoft  dot com.  So he said to mitigate this further, we added the sandbox policy to the pages, which prevents  these kinds of attacks.  So he writes, what have we learned from the honeypot?  Our sensor network has contributed to many successes over the years.  We've presented these at computer security conferences in the past as well as shared  our data with academia and the community.  We incorporate this data into our security products  to enable them to be aware of the latest threats.  In recent years, this capability has been crucial  to understanding the zero day and end day ecosystem.  During the log for shell incident,  we were able to use our sensor network  to track each iteration of the underlying vulnerability  and associated proof of concept  all the way back to GitHub.  This helped us understand the groups involved  in productionizing the exploit and where it was being targeted.  Our data enables internal teams to be much better prepared  to remediate and provides the analysis  for detection authors to improve products  like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint in real time.  That's MDE.  The team developing this capability  also works closely with the MSRC who track our own security issues.  When the Exchange proxy logon vulnerability was announced,  we had already written a full exploit handler in our environment  to track and understand not just the exploit,  but the groups deploying it.  This kind of situational awareness enables us to give clearer advice to  industry, better protect our customers and integrate new threats we are seeing into Windows,  Windows Defender and MDE. The domain code.microsoft.com was often critical to the success of this,  as well as a useful early warning system. When new vulnerabilities have been announced,  threat actors can often be too consumed with trying to use the vulnerability as quickly as  possible than checking for deception infrastructure like a  honeypot. As a result, code.microsoft.com often saw  exploits first. Many of these exploits were attributed to  threat actors, MSTIC already tracks. Okay, so it is very  interesting that the announcement of a new  vulnerability immediately triggers a mass frenzy as  that, but we've talked about this effect before, right? As attackers who are literally  everywhere scurry to take advantage of it before machines are patched. Okay, so the  author continues, what happened next? He says, the code subdomain had been known to bug bounty  researchers for several years. So whenever they would receive a report from someone who  believed that they had discovered a critical vulnerability for this domain, these would  be closed to let them know they had found a honeypot.  We've asked these security professionals to refrain from publishing details of this service  in an effort to protect the value we received from it.  We've also understood for a while that this subdomain would eventually need to be retired  once its existence had become too well known to be of value.  That time finally arrived.  On April 25, a sudden uptick in traffic to the subdomain and posts on Twitter revealed  that the domain was being investigated by broad groups of individuals.  Since this discovery meant that the secret was out and the subdomain had lost its value,  we decided to fully reveal the truth and retire the system.  I have a chart in the show notes that shows this,  where they're basically ticking along at almost nothing.  And then over the course of a couple of days,  the traffic just explodes.  He said, the timeline gives an order of events  from our perspective.  It's unknown exactly how the full exploit URL of our server  server ended up in Google search database.  But it looks like this.  And the associated discovery on Twitter slash X culminated in almost 80,000 WeChat exploits  in a three hour period.  It's unlikely that Google crawler would have naturally found the URL.  Our current theory is that a security researcher found this and submitted a report to Microsoft.  As part of this process, either the Chrome browser or another app found this URL and  submitted it for indexing.  In other words, it's very difficult to keep anything a secret on the internet.  It's easy to imagine that Google would have set up Chrome to feed URLs back to them for  bot crawling indexing.  That way, users of Chrome are unwittingly providing Google with links to index as a  means for assuring that Google bots are able to discover everything, even things that are  not pointed to by anybody else, as in this case.  In this case, they somehow discovered a secret that Microsoft had been trying to keep quiet  for several years.  The timeline showed that in March, the WeChat exploit appeared in Google search results  for the first time.  On April 15, a redacted screenshot of an exploit mitigation was posted online and some debate  followed as to whether the domain was for the code.microsoft.com subdomain.  Six days later on the 21st of April, Google Trends show that many people were now searching  for the code domains.  Three days after that on the 24th, they start noticing a significant uptick in traffic to  the subdomain.  And finally on the 26th, they are hit with 126,000 times more requests than average.  They write, by the 26th of April, we were handling 160,000 requests per day, up from  the usual between five and 100.  Most of these requests were to a single endpoint handling a vulnerability in the WeChat broadcast  plugin for WordPress.  That's CVE 2018 16283.  This enabled anyone to run a command from a parameter in the URL.  Looking at these URLs, we found 11,000 different commands being attempted.  Most of these pushed a message by some group or another, stating that the site had been  hacked by them.  So just ego.  This was a simulation, so nothing happened.  Removing these messages gave a clearer picture of the kinds of commands people were entering.  Most commands entered were Linux recon commands.  These attempted to find out what the system was, what files it contained, and more broadly  what value it was to Microsoft. The next biggest group were running command. These  ranged from basic Linux commands like who am I, but a few enterprising folks went on  to run scripts of various languages. Most people who interacted didn't get further than the  WeChat exploit. Over the three busiest days, 63 different exploits in total were triggered.  The biggest surprise was that most researchers stuck to HTTP.  Only three groups probed the other ports and even fewer logged into the many other services  that were available.  Some of the best investigation came from a Twitter handle at SimplyLurking2 on Twitter  slash X, who after discovering that the system was a honeypot, continued to analyze what  we had in place and constructed. First constructing a RIC role and then a URL  that when visited would display a message to right-click and save a payload.  With so much information now publicly available the value of this subdomain  was diminished. On April 26th we replaced the site with a 404 message and  and are working on retiring the subdomain completely.  However, our ongoing data collection efforts  are undiminished.  Microsoft's runs many of these collection services  across multiple data centers.  Our concept has been proven,  and we have rolled out similar capabilities  at higher scales in many other locations worldwide.  These continue to give us a detailed picture  of emerging threats.  So that's the story of the rise and fall of a honeypot,  which Microsoft inadvertently created,  but then managed to put to great use and advantage  for several good years before its identity finally leaked  and was made public, thus rendering it useless.  We've also seen how the tip of the iceberg for a honeypot  is that it can detect that something is wrong  on the network. That's generally sufficient for most purposes. But this, but as we see,  this can also be taken far beyond simple detection with a sufficiently advanced vulnerability  simulator to reveal exactly what bad guys will do when they're given more rope to hang  themselves.  I love it. You know, I,  Wow.  I used to go to code.microsoft.com all the time to download VS code.  I had no idea that they had abandoned it.  That is a wild story.  Wow.  Yeah.  And Leo, again, the idea that like not having something responding to code.microsoft.com,  which used to be hosted by Azure, allowed somebody else to register that.  I again, I hope, I hope that there's somebody's looking at this architecture because something  is broken. If that's possible, you shouldn't be able to go to create a sub domain. If the  domain is owned by somebody else, that doesn't make any sense. I know. I know it's, it's,  it's insane. Is it still that way? I mean, should I worry about Twitter TV people getting  and subdomains on our own.  Are you on Azure?  No.  Ha ha ha ha.  Then I, whoo!  I'm not.  Oh, what a relief.  No, I mean, no one's ever heard of this.  This is just nuts.  It's crazy.  The only thing, so code.microsoft.com  must have pointed to an IP in Azure.  Right.  And something is rotten in Denmark.  I've got nothing against Denmark,  but like, that's wow.  You blame the registrar. I mean, isn't that or the DNS resolver? Isn't that?  No, no. It's somebody who somehow created their own Azure instance. And because it was named code.microsoft.com,  that's all it is. The name somehow it glued itself to that sub domain, which they called dangling a dangling  sub domain. Dangling. No one's ever heard of a dangling sub domain. Sub domains don't dangle.  I made that up.  What a story.  Well at least they got some good out of it, right?  I think that's...  Yeah, it did.  They turned it around and the fact that it was in Microsoft and they had some seriously  cool tech.  I mean, again, what I think must be the case is I was reading this to our listeners, I  was thinking, why don't we get the sense in general that Microsoft is this good?  I mean, they were, they are, there are parts of Microsoft that are really good.  They're smart people.  They're just so, they're buried so deeply down in, in the infrastructure that, you know,  you just talk to morons on the surface.  Well, I don't even think it's that.  I think it's just so complex that things fall through the cracks.  So David Reddicop was in there.  Oh, Leo, just go to answers.microsoft.com and you will swim in moron, the most moronic  nonsense you have ever seen.  The intern did it.  It's the interns fault.  David Renicop, who we were just talking about,  is in our Discord.  I guess you're a club member.  Thank you, David.  He said, Azure is the authoritative DNS  for an Azure tenant.  And there's your problem right there, right?  They've decided.  Yeah, we don't even know.  We don't even know stinking DNS servers.  Well, we'll do it.  We'll resolve the domain.  We can do that.
