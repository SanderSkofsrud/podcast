    <p>what does beauty have to do with <span class="replace">sports or</span> advanced technology or the economy i am isabella <span class="replace">roussellini</span> and in each episode of this is not a beauty podcast i uncover stories that explain beauty's fascinating and often hidden <span class="replace">role in modern</span> life listen to this is not a beauty podcast now <span class="delete">available</span> on your favorite podcast platform brought to you by <span class="delete">the</span> l'oréal group <span class="replace">jay</span> what's up i was at a party last month and <span class="replace">the</span> song came on <span class="replace">she'd</span> take <span class="replace">the</span> money and you know normally <span class="replace">well</span> i'm <span class="replace">a kneeheat</span> my first impulse with <span class="replace">the</span> song <span class="replace">is</span> to just get my eagle on <span class="delete">music uh she give me money i ain't saying she a golddigger</span> but i really did not understand how the dj didn't get the memo <span class="delete">mm</span> so i just <span class="replace">did</span> there on the dance floor not dancing <span class="delete">what</span> did you want to happen i just wanted to not have to think about him <span class="insert">that's</span> right you just wanted to <span class="replace">do it</span> the night <span class="delete">that's all i wanted</span> yeah i just wanted to enjoy the night this was me just like running out of runway to let this person's ideology fly if we can even call it an ideology but mostly what i was feeling out there on the dance floor was just like another occasion for me to sit in my blackness and figure out what that is all about it's tough right it's really frustrating and it's difficult to try to figure out our relationship to someone we don't even know <span class="delete">yeah yes</span> but <span class="replace">who's working how to</span> relationship to for decades so thinking about divesting from that is <span class="delete">it's</span> painful it's not a small thing no it's huge and it's so huge that i <span class="delete">i</span> have to be done <span class="replace">mmhmm</span> now when i say done i don't mean i'm going to come after people who play the music in my presence i just think that i <span class="insert">wesley morris</span> am done trying to make a kind of intellectual sense <span class="delete">yeah</span> of the artist formerly known as kanye west who now goes by <span class="replace">yay</span> i just it's we're in deeply vile territory and i can't make intellectual sense of that i'm where you're at i'm past the point of sadness yes yes <span class="delete">i'm</span> into a place of rage <span class="replace">this comfort</span> and historically speaking there has been a lot of grace for <span class="delete">ye</span> right probably more than he actually deserved <span class="replace">it</span> i'm thinking about choosing to associate with donald trump and going to trump tower <span class="delete">you know</span> there has been mounting misogyny mounting sexism that got overlooked <span class="delete">right</span> got a pass because the music was so good now we're reaching a point where all that's compounding the list is very long includes the white lives matter shirt paris fashion week this <span class="replace">apporn</span> interview he gives most recently on alex <span class="replace">jones</span> show i'm not <span class="replace">gonna</span> repeat what he said because it's way too vile there's no redemption there's no accountability every single time this person <span class="replace">has</span> given a chance including being allowed back on twitter <span class="replace">neja's</span> double down you and i have talked about kanye many many many times over the course of the show the last time we tried to untangle this topic together we decided together we were not <span class="replace">gonna</span> give up on kanye that we were invested in him and his project <span class="delete">and</span> his mission and curious about it a day has arrived where how we feel is different yeah so let's get into it let's talk about it and also just notice how the atmosphere in this room has changed yeah it's always a party in <span class="replace">this</span> studio yeah today it's <span class="replace">funerary</span> let's talk about why i'm <span class="replace">jayworthum</span> i'm wesley morris and we're two cultural undertakers at the new york times and this is still processing can we go back to 2004 take me there 2004 <span class="replace">the</span> college <span class="replace">dropout</span> comes out and i was really feeling like here was a person i had kind of been waiting for wow this guy was <span class="replace">a conicalastic</span> in his insistence <span class="insert">that</span> that there are rules that you don't have to follow to become a successful black person wow he drops out of college the <span class="replace">or</span> i graduate and one of the things we get taught as a people is that one of the things that really helps us succeed is going to get a college degree and there was something about <span class="replace">it's</span> mocking insistence that it's the wrong way to go <span class="replace">ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha</span> but i just kind of sat there and was like for a lot of us this is a way out <span class="insert">it's</span> getting a college education it feels important to <span class="replace">note</span> that at this exact same moment in time another college dropout is releasing something that will also disrupt notions of productivity <span class="replace">ingenious and</span> you know <span class="replace">introducing</span> entirely new paradigm which is mark zuckerberg famous college <span class="replace">drop out</span> launches <span class="replace">the facebookcom</span> and i just bring that up to say that album for me also challenged the idea that the other means of success was to somehow figure out how to be a really savvy college dropout who created a multimillion dollar app that then <span class="replace">skyrocketed</span> you to <span class="replace">start them in</span> success because that was the pressure for my generation at that time right it was this idea of we are at the forefront of a brand new technological revolution and if you can't figure it out you're going to be left behind and kanye college dropout just also offered a way to say unsubscribe maybe i don't want that either but the way i received aspects of the college dropout album was that <span class="replace">you</span> was essentially challenging what i can only describe as <span class="insert">like</span> a black <span class="replace">orghtedoxy</span> that points to <span class="replace">middleclass</span> black success as looking a particular way i didn't have a problem with that that wasn't an <span class="replace">or i</span> didn't feel like an orthodoxy to me but the way that kanye west was thinking about it it was what i found so moving about kanye's alternativeness is that he was still a scholar <span class="delete">and</span> instead of someone presenting papers or dissertations what he was doing was he was presenting lineage through music right through sampling you know part of kanye's early success resides entirely in his uncanny and <span class="replace">genius like</span> ability to <span class="replace">meet</span> match <span class="replace">and hold</span> tiny snippets and choruses and parts of songs <span class="delete">music blood on the leaves</span> i just need to clear my mind <span class="delete">now</span> and step on them screw them smash them <span class="delete">music through the fire to the limit to the wire i spit it through the wire young man</span> so they sound completely different and also extremely familiar and some people call that production but i also call that archive work because what you're doing <span class="delete">yeah of course</span> is pulling from the past to make something new for the future it's a way of honoring your musical lineage it's a way of honoring your musical ancestors giving them <span class="delete">their</span> flowers in real time and a key example of that craftsmanship shines on <span class="delete">“all falls down ” music when it all when it</span> all falls down <span class="delete">this is the real one baby i'm telling you all when it all falls down southside southside</span> which is pulled from <span class="replace">lauren hills do you have a have a statingly</span> iconic <span class="replace">unplugged</span> 2002 mtv live performance <span class="delete">music when it all all falls down yeah telling you all</span> and she's really talking about the <span class="replace">corosiveness</span> of fame the music industry sexism by the way <span class="replace">connie actually</span> didn't get permission to use the original sample but he ends up bringing a chicago singer in <span class="replace">selena</span> johnson to sing the <span class="replace">hugs</span> that he uses so it's an <span class="replace">interpolation of lauren</span> hill's album but that's a way of again referencing an artist that at that time a lot of people weren't thinking about <span class="delete">mmhm mmhm music west mr west uh yeah uh yeah</span> i'm also thinking of a song like <span class="replace">hurtem say</span> which includes this just incredibly delicate and <span class="replace">lise</span> piano work <span class="delete">music yeah</span> and i heard <span class="replace">him</span> say nothing's ever promised <span class="replace">to model</span> today that's <span class="delete">a</span> sample from a natalie <span class="replace">colson i'm one</span> in this world that <span class="replace">i long ways</span> to love his work with sampling and production was really really really validating to think about musical artistry and deep archival knowledge as being just as important as anything else <span class="replace">he</span> might study in college and the music was fun it was fun to listen to and what was really exciting about that was that the art seemed free the person who made the art seemed free the sort of personal freedom to be whoever kanye west the individual is and if that happens to lead to thinking in a way that isn't like other black people most black people then so be it he was the latest black american artist to find a way to express in his own way what freedom could sound like listening to kanye at least gave me hope that someone is thinking about another way so to have someone like kanye come out very boldly and exuberantly and to say i'm creating my own <span class="replace">politics and</span> has nothing to do with what the <span class="replace">hugs to bulls</span> were up to because that's what we're really also talking about here right now which is a black paradigm that had been set up and created by the <span class="replace">hugs to bulls</span> and here's someone <span class="replace">i'll say</span> i don't know i think there's another way <span class="delete">archived recording</span> those are my people down <span class="replace">i said</span> anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with this is also the period where he goes on that hurricane katrina <span class="replace">telephone</span> there's now over 25 feet of water where there was one city streets and <span class="replace">stan's</span> next to mike myers and says <span class="delete">archived recording</span> george bush doesn't care about black people he looked terrified when he did it and that moment made him a folk hero essentially he was expressing feelings that a lot of black people in this country felt about the president at that time and after these first three albums the next three <span class="replace">eight o'clock in the heartbreak and my</span> beautiful dark twisted <span class="replace">fantasy and jesus</span> have some of that vulnerability to me like he is <span class="delete">he's</span> risking something here in terms of how big he wants to make his ego how small he wants to make it i think those are three albums that are about a person wrestling with something else there is during this what i would describe as a vulnerability period this turn into darkness <span class="replace">and degrimness</span> and the whole time <span class="insert">one of the</span> one of the thrills of these albums is that as a listener you're kind of like your hand is near the panic button even as the music is kind of blowing your mind it seemed like for kanye during this time that as he became more successful the initial disruption that he created right and the freedom that <span class="insert">that</span> allowed him perhaps <span class="replace">we'll start into trapping</span> right i'm thinking really specifically about that 2013 <span class="replace">zain low</span> interview <span class="delete">oh</span> where he's asked about the song on <span class="replace">he's as</span> titled <span class="replace">i</span> am a <span class="replace">gods</span> it's a very <span class="replace">fast pace</span> aggressive song <span class="delete">music i am a god</span> that just felt like an <span class="replace">exercise</span> of some kind and i honestly didn't really grapple with the lyrics too much and then you have him in this interview where he's like <span class="delete">archived recording</span> everybody says who does he think he is i just told you who i thought i was <span class="replace">oh</span> god and that part of the interview is always <span class="replace">accepted</span> as an example of this turn you're describing where we're seeing an artist who's wrestling with inner demons that aren't yet fully outside of themselves in a way like it's very internal conflict but that interview goes on and what he says next is so illuminating he's like <span class="delete">archived recording</span> would it <span class="delete">have</span> been better if i had a <span class="replace">son as i'm a gangster</span> or if i had a <span class="replace">son as i'm a pimp</span> because society is a lot more comfortable with me describing myself <span class="replace">and</span> those terms but when i say i'm a god that's when people have a problem but there is this sense of someone who feels like they're not being recognized for how great they are and that's a really different approach than early kanye which is talking about i don't care what you think about me i'm going to carve a new path i'm <span class="replace">a</span> blaze <span class="replace">of</span> new way follow me if you want whatever and this kanye is saying you do not recognize me for how great i am and there's a marked difference there yeah and he goes on tour <span class="replace">the</span> life of <span class="replace">pablo towards</span> 2016 and he's giving these erratic speeches from the stage and there's a horrible assault robbery incident involving kim kardashian and during the tour he is hospitalized with exhaustion and the first thing that he does when he gets out of the hospital <span class="delete">archived recording kanye what are you doing here today</span> is go to trump tower <span class="replace">power</span> and it wasn't just that he goes to trump tower a month after the election he goes <span class="replace">blonde i hear</span> color that basically matches donald trump's <span class="delete">archived recording just friends just friends and he's a good man</span> and the press is trying to ask <span class="replace">you a</span> questions and he doesn't answer <span class="replace">gage is</span> stands there <span class="delete">hm archived recording 1 president elect of the united states nothing to say archived recording 2 i just want to take a picture right now</span> and that was the beginning of some kind of change like i mean it was not the beginning that was the culmination to me of an evolution toward something that felt unsavory and potentially dangerous all the things you're describing <span class="insert">wesley</span> is actually why i decided to go see <span class="replace">say pablo</span> right the tour for <span class="replace">the</span> life of <span class="replace">pablo</span> because that album was so confounding to me right you have a song like <span class="replace">ultra lightbeam</span> which is kind of about redemption you've got kirk franklin <span class="delete">music</span> father this <span class="replace">press</span> for everyone <span class="replace">the fills are</span> not good enough the expert on black redemption <span class="insert">the black</span> community and gospel singing <span class="replace">the</span> song with chance about new beginnings and hope and optimism <span class="delete">music</span> we <span class="replace">wanna coach a leg game</span> we <span class="replace">wanna coach a leg game</span> this is a god dream and that song goes right into <span class="replace">father shrecht</span> my hands <span class="replace">part one</span> beautiful morning <span class="replace">get a son of a</span> morning <span class="replace">fan</span> and then he starts talking about <span class="replace">i have my foot this bottle and</span> she just bleached her <span class="replace">ass off</span> which i don't have <span class="replace">world</span> judgment around but in the context of the key changes of <span class="replace">the</span> song is really <span class="replace">a funling</span> so with all this <span class="replace">had been</span> me <span class="replace">and</span> good faith get a ticket go to <span class="replace">say in public</span> concert i think i went by myself and i was struck by a few things one the entire concert pretty much was attended by white people there was something interesting there the stage mechanics of that performance kanye was <span class="replace">spending</span> on a platform that was shrouded in light so much so that you couldn't see the audience <span class="delete">like</span> i mean this is always true of a concert right the performer is highlighted but usually there are these roving spotlights on the crowd so you can see everyone else in their state of ecstasy and you're getting giddy off of their <span class="replace">goodness and the</span> kanye there really wasn't any interest in being able to see the audience all eyes were on kanye and the platform was <span class="replace">cleaning</span> around the arena yeah it was cantilevered and so the people below it were shrouded in darkness so you could only just see this teeming mass of kanye's <span class="replace">accolades</span> essentially reaching their hands up i mean it looked like a caravaggio painting or something <span class="replace">and</span> had very gothic elements <span class="delete">to it</span> i'd say bosch <span class="replace">heronum is</span> bosch it just felt really clear that kanye's selfrendering was completely transformed and that where he was we weren't meant to access one of the things that you and i have been thinking about together in our work separately is what does ultimate absolute freedom for black people in this country look like one of the things that seemed like <span class="replace">ea</span> was trying to show us was maybe it does look like voting for republicans if you are conservative you should be free enough to do that <span class="replace">i</span> shouldn't you be able to go on twitter and with a <span class="replace">mag ahead</span> on and <span class="insert">well</span> i don't see why <span class="insert">i</span> shouldn't i be able to do this because i'm me i'm not representing black people i'm representing me <span class="replace">yay okay</span> but well i don't think that's freedom it's not an expansive idea it's not an idea that's actually imagining something new and i'm drawing a lot of my thinking from a book that has really been moving me in my own research <span class="replace">for</span> my projects called <span class="replace">the longamensipation</span> by <span class="replace">renato</span> walcott which is trying to help us distinguish between ideas of emancipation and freedom yeah his point is that emancipation served as a way to think about not slavery <span class="delete">yes yes right</span> but it wasn't freedom right because the <span class="replace">newly emancipated</span> black people in this country still had a ton i mean we still do but there was a ton of sociopolitical restrictions and limitations on what kind of jobs you could have where you could live policing on your hair policing on your body i mean we have an approximation of freedom but because we're still in this postslavery economy it's really hard to know what it would actually mean to be free and so the book is asking us to think about being in a long period of emancipation rather than ever having approached freedom i want that freedom for all of us i just have a really hard time believing that a true expression of freedom comes at the expense of other people's safety other people's humanities and other people's sense of dignity well that's the point at which his going to paris during paris fashion week and wearing the tshirt that says <span class="replace">white</span> lives <span class="replace">matter</span> comes in right not just that <span class="replace">all</span> lives <span class="replace">matter</span> that would have been bad enough but he <span class="replace">wore a shirt that</span> said <span class="replace">a white</span> lives <span class="replace">matter</span> talking about like i'm going to go <span class="replace">deathcon</span> 3 <span class="replace">deathcon</span> 3 <span class="replace">d e a t h</span> con 3 on jewish people for <span class="insert">for</span> me that was the moment where i mean all the wheels fall off the wheels had been <span class="replace">fallen</span> off the bus for a minute though right yes yes yes yes it's important to remember that kanye has been practicing <span class="replace">misogyny war</span> for a really long time songs like <span class="replace">golddigger</span> right even songs like <span class="replace">flashing lights</span> you know there's always <span class="replace">a</span> narrative that just paints him as a victim to greedy black women <span class="delete">and</span> the entire narrative around amber rose <span class="replace">a</span> lord in the aftermath of their relationship <span class="delete">yeah</span> he just painted her as this opportunistic greedy little slut and he had to take 30 showers after he broke up with her and that was on the radio and everybody laughed the culture was just like yeah who cares about her i'm probably <span class="delete">as</span> guilty as anybody we all are i mean we're talking about this cultural complacency and our role in helping create this social monster that we have today <span class="delete">mmhm</span> so there had already been a lot of corrosive behavior towards a lot of vulnerable people before all of this blew up in the last handful of months well i mean i think we should take a break and when we come back we should talk about exactly how blown up things are because whatever <span class="replace">scene</span> free about this person is actually the opposite my name is audrey <span class="replace">diaz burge</span> and i am a national correspondent <span class="insert">covering race and identity</span> for the new york times race coverage is complicated it can be joyous <span class="insert">and affirming</span> it can be uncomfortable but i feel <span class="replace">like it's still</span> absolutely necessary <span class="insert">race and identity are</span> not just <span class="delete">for</span> understanding who you are but <span class="replace">who</span> the person in front of you <span class="replace">is and wanting to understand more about them we're</span> trying to wrestle <span class="replace">down</span> these really hard subjects and maybe not <span class="delete">always</span> answering the <span class="replace">question</span> but asking the right <span class="replace">questions</span> and listening listening <span class="insert">listening</span> a lot the times is dedicated to ambitious and <span class="replace">deeply reported coverage of recent</span> identity and <span class="replace">their</span> willing to back it up with <span class="delete">the necessary</span> resources if you are curious about the world <span class="insert">on which</span> we live <span class="replace">if you're interested in who you are where you come from and how you relate to others</span> i would encourage you to subscribe <span class="replace">after</span> the new york times it's hard to really talk about where i think kanye is at and what i think is going on with him because the truth is i don't know i'm <span class="replace">on</span> inside that man's brain i'm not inside anybody's head but my own what's coming up for me <span class="replace">and</span> all of this is that this is not the first time we have been here as a people <span class="delete">mmhm</span> other people have made this choice to try to challenge what we initially were calling an orthodoxy right but what it really is <span class="insert">is</span> our sense of community one of the earliest people who comes to mind is a guy named george <span class="replace">skyler</span> wrote one of my favorite books <span class="replace">is</span> called <span class="replace">black</span> no <span class="replace">more look at the</span> came out in 1931 and it's basically about a scientist who creates a way for black people to become white and the main character undergoes this procedure turns from a black person to a white person and becomes a <span class="replace">big wig</span> in a white supremacist organization that's kind of like the kkk <span class="replace">mary's</span> the daughter of the head <span class="replace">clansman</span> who is trying to stop this racechanging procedure <span class="replace">from</span> making things worse for white people how does the technology impact your dna well funny you should ask because whenever in this novel a black person who's turned white reproduces with their new white spouse they produce a black baby right right <span class="replace">that's</span> my question the dna don't lie and that's the point of the satire right but at some point everybody's confused about everything in this book including i would say george <span class="replace">skyler ok</span> who in the years after its publication becomes increasingly conservative and increasingly antiblack you know he releases statements like condemning martin luther king <span class="replace">is</span> being nothing more than a <span class="replace">hoxster</span> and then let's just fast forward to clarence thomas who begins his intellectual life as a black nationalist and winds up on the supreme court as what as far as i can see <span class="replace">is it's</span> most conservative member and he's been on the court longer than anybody at this point and essentially his <span class="replace">george pyrdons</span> amounts to casting a vote against every piece of civil rights legislation that comes to the court racial equity racial fairness racial justice and the reason to bring george <span class="replace">skyler</span> and clarence thomas into our conversation about kanye west <span class="insert">j</span> is just to how could they express their own beliefs as individual americans and what happens when those beliefs don't necessarily correspond with the majority of black americans does that mean that the rest of us are sheep and that these are the free thinkers or are <span class="insert">they</span> what <span class="insert">you know</span> classically gets called uncle <span class="replace">tom's</span> because all that alleged free thinking just winds up doing more harm to people black people jews i mean all people we've been talking about this in terms of freedom but i wonder if it's a question of their imaginations right <span class="delete">mm like</span> the imagination is so limited i mean i've been thinking so much in our conversation about robin g <span class="replace">kelly's</span> book <span class="replace">freedom dreams</span> where he tries to go back and chronicle what black activists have been doing to try to imagine their ways out of the constraints that <span class="replace">were in</span> that we're trying to go someplace we've never been before and new tools and tactics are required <span class="delete">yes</span> yes yes that true liberation really does involve the imagination because we can't see what we don't know yet and i think that's why i keep coming back to this idea of how limited this imagination is to talk about violence whether it's against women you've dated <span class="insert">people</span> you <span class="delete">know people</span> feel <span class="replace">your incompetent</span> to is so unimaginative and boring and completely uninteresting in addition to it just being completely unacceptable that's what discounts kanye for me the problem is the closer it got to white supremacy the less interesting the art became <span class="insert">mmhmm</span> as long as you're out there trying to align a <span class="replace">whitelives</span> matter tshirt with an artistic practice your art <span class="replace">is</span> run aground your art <span class="replace">is</span> run out of anything interesting or new to say right the turning point for me around kanye though was him lashing out at the <span class="replace">vogue</span> editor <span class="replace">i would</span> around the same time <span class="replace">they were on</span> the same time <span class="replace">they were on the same time the one</span> lives matter shirts <span class="replace">happened</span> i was watching it unfold on instagram stories so i was watching along with <span class="replace">vogue</span> contributing editor gabriella <span class="replace">carifa johnson</span> who was at that show in october and you know she said to promote these ideas and white supremacist ideology on a fashion show and loop in black people to also promote it she's saying is a very scary and dangerous and violent thing she was just like this isn't art this isn't good art <span class="delete">yeah</span> and kanye immediately singled her out <span class="insert">mm</span> he posted a picture of her he mocked her clothes he mocked her shoes i mean this is someone who has millions and millions of people following him and to direct the fire hose of that attention at this black woman is a very scary and unsettling thing to do and immediately so many people <span class="replace">jump</span> to her defense people are posting talking about her right to express her critique and criticism as a <span class="replace">vocated or a</span> fashion <span class="replace">meet</span> that's literally what they're sent there to do and what ends up happening is a meeting between all of them <span class="replace">as a range</span> and then kanye tweets out like we're good now this is my sister yeah it's just chaos i think what we're i mean i think the other other thing we're talking about is this other race of people what they're called famous people oh yeah <span class="replace">famous</span> a race yeah it is <span class="insert">it's just</span> i mean <span class="insert">if if</span> if black white <span class="insert">you know</span> those are all constructs this one is too so is fame and at some point i think famous people really think that their fame and power <span class="delete">empowers them</span> and money you're talking about money <span class="delete">money</span> like money is the thing that <span class="replace">undergrad's</span> all this too yes and i think all those things <span class="replace">entitled</span> people to say and do whatever it is they want maybe kanye isn't black maybe he's just famous in his mind what do you mean by that i mean that the story that it would seem that he can tell himself is that it's the george <span class="replace">skyler</span> story it's the <span class="replace">black</span> no <span class="replace">more</span> story <span class="delete">mmhm</span> i have moved over <span class="insert">it</span> to this other side and i think it's pretty great look at me i just put a bunch of people in <span class="replace">whitelazed</span> matter tshirts and sent them out at a fashion show <span class="insert">mm</span> i mean what black person would think to do that me you and i arrived in strangely different places like the way i'm orienting myself right now is i'm trying to ask of myself different questions as a consumer as a cultural critic as a thinker like i am really trying to assess what in me let me overlook those things for so long and how can i pay that attention forward who are some of the <span class="replace">artist</span> creators thinkers producers right now who deserve some of that energy right i'm thinking about tems <span class="replace">i finnaf</span> i'm thinking of a ton of incredibly talented black women artists who are coming up right now who are geniuses and i'm just trying to do my own reparative work and understand how i can do better differently right because i recognize that i'm part of the economy that gave kanye permission for so long because i'm not going to be able to change kanye i can't ask him to show up differently i can't even you know the only work i can do is really analyze my own priorities and interests <span class="replace">in</span> curiosities i think the thing that has brought us together to talk about this is not that it is happening or that it is news <span class="insert">hmm hmm</span> i think the reason that for many of us the problem presented by this person is personal i mean it's individually personal <span class="delete">right</span> like the thing about <span class="replace">college dropout</span> that so bothered me was that i received it as an indictment not actually of getting an education i received it as an indictment of getting an education with white people he doesn't say any of that on <span class="replace">that</span> but i went to yale the numbers just made it so that most of my friends were white and one of the things that we black people talked about a lot was what it's going to mean to then have these relationships these close friendships with white people the fear i felt was that i would get to this school and get this education but that it was <span class="replace">gonna</span> cost me something <span class="delete">hmm right</span> and the price was going to be my blackness even though i live a life among white people <span class="replace">or what</span> people in my life there have been white people in my bed i've never ever ever felt in danger of losing my sense of who i am as a black american person but i've always worried yeah and wondered simultaneously why why am i not making the same choices kanye west made he's got stage <span class="replace">four</span> cancer of the thing that i am a hypochondriac about you know what i'm thinking of right now you know <span class="replace">when the</span> walking <span class="replace">dead</span> when they go to the cdc this is <span class="insert">like</span> pretty early on it's probably season one <span class="replace">i'd bear</span> my soul you pull out <span class="replace">the</span> walking <span class="replace">dead okay</span> but listen hear me out hear me out i'm <span class="replace">here okay</span> early on <span class="replace">an amc is the</span> walking <span class="replace">dead</span> someone gets the idea that we should go to the cdc because that's where all the answers will be they make <span class="replace">the</span> way there and they realize that the virus that turns people <span class="replace">and</span> zombies after they've been killed is in all of them that all of them are actually already infected there is no <span class="replace">the infected and</span> only activates after <span class="replace">your debt</span> and it's a <span class="replace">heart crushing</span> episode because you realize that the cure <span class="replace">they've</span> been looking for doesn't really seem to exist and everyone at any moment has the potential to become <span class="replace">accountable</span> to turn on themselves really first and then everyone else around them so i'm listening to talk and i'm thinking about this way in which this fear that there could be something latent inside of all of us that turns us unrecognizable and that also is related to white supremacy <span class="delete">you know</span> we all <span class="replace">grew</span> up in this world it's all in the water and what's between you and me and <span class="insert">someone like kanye</span> someone like kanye is mental health issues right a lot of money a lot of enabling and a lot of selfloathing and an economy that's not stopping you but yeah the worry that somehow we'll lose track of ourselves that's a real fear and it's not unfounded the fear that i have is <span class="insert">that</span> what you so beautifully encapsulated <span class="replace">is</span> being <span class="insert">a</span> like a latent possibility in all of us it's so depressing and infuriating to watch it proliferate in somebody else i mean we haven't even talked about really the fact that kanye west is not well <span class="insert">and</span> and no one knows what to do about that unwellness and it makes me think about amy winehouse it makes me think about a certain era of britney <span class="replace">spears'</span> life when someone's spiral that feels like it's approaching a death spiral is just tabloid fodder there's an attention economy which is why people are talking about divesting from kanye and just stopping paying attention stop paying attention <span class="delete">but</span> what i'm also hearing you say is that the real freedom in this scenario is our freedom to leave him out there yeah i mean it's sad it's really really sad and the only power that we have as a society is just to say like we do not tolerate this and we don't condone this and that's where we're at with kanye but i do think that it's not about leaving kanye it's about leaving someone who is completely unwilling to be accountable for the harms they're causing and that the only way to inoculate ourselves i was thinking about an infection from <span class="replace">its</span> spreading is to quarantine ourselves <span class="replace">in herz</span> it does that's our show <span class="replace">still processing</span> is produced by <span class="replace">elisabeth</span>
