     Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.  The show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and wonderful things  about the world at the same time as improving your English.  I'm Alice Debudge and today we are going to be talking about the death of Princess Diana.  It is the story of a princess, the press, the royal family, and what people called the utterly  preventable death of a young woman.  Okay then, let's get started and talk about the death of Princess Diana.  In the early hours of Sunday, August 31, 1997, a black Mercedes-Benz entered the Pong de Lelma  underpass, a tunnel under the sand river in Paris. The car was going fast, with later reports  estimating it was travelling at 105 km per hour, more than double the tunnel's 50 km  hour speed limit. There was a good reason for this, or at least you could understand why the driver  was going so fast. The car was being chased by a reported 30 paparazzi photographers  on moepeds and in cars. Cameras were flashing as the photographers were weaved around the car,  poking their cameras at the tinted windows, the shutters clicking nonstop.  For inside the car was Diana, Princess of Wales, the former wife of the heir to the British  throne and, almost certainly, the most recognizable woman in the world.  Next to her was Do-D-Fayette, the son of the Egyptian businessman and owner of the Harrod's  department store, Mohammed Al-Fayette.  Nobody knows exactly what Diana and Do-Di were talking about on that trip back, but the whole  world would know what happened next.  that exactly 23 minutes passed 12, shortly after entering the tunnel, the driver lost control  of the car. The Mercedes smashed into another car and then crashed head on into a pillar.  Niver Dodi nor Diana were wearing a seat belt. Dodi fired was pronounced dead at the  seen, along with the driver, Oli Paul. Diana was still alive, as was the only other occupant  of the car, Dori's bodyguard, a man called Trevor Restions. She was still conscious, and  was able to talk to the doctors who were fighting to save her life. Unfortunately, it was  an unwindable fight. The impact from the crash had been so great that her heart was pushed  out of place, and this tour a pulmonary vein causing massive internal bleeding.  At 4 o'clock in the morning, after almost 3 and a half hours of French doctors fighting  to save her life, Diana Princess of Wales, the woman many people had thought would become  Queen, was pronounced dead.  This much of the story I imagine you will know already, but what we will do in this  episode is trying to go a level deeper and unpack what was happening before the crash,  the crash itself and it's aftermath.  But first let me give a very brief reminder about the protagonist of our story.  Princess Diana or Diana Spencer as she was before she became a princess was born on July  first 1961 to an aristocratic British family. Her family had extensive ties to the royal family.  Diana was a distant cousin of Charles, Diana's grandmother was friends with Charles' grandmother,  and Diana's family even lived in a large mansion that they rented from Queen Elizabeth.  On the surface, Diana had a very privileged upbringing, but emotionally it was not a happy  one. Her mother left her father when she was seven years old, and Diana would  like to say that her childhood was very unhappy. Her family was well known in aristocratic  British circles, but it wasn't until her relationship with Prince Charles that she truly  became a household name across the world. At the age of 20, she married Prince Charles in  a ceremony that was watched by over 750 million people. It was a spectacle of royal pomp  and glamour that made her an icon overnight. But while her marriage to Prince Charles was made  out to be a fairytale for the press and the public. The reality was quite different. Behind  the scenes, the marriage was troubled from the stars. With the most well-known issue being  Charles's ongoing affair with his former lover, Camilla Parker Bowles, who you might know  is now his wife. Diana and Charles separated in 1992 and would officially divorce four years  later in 1996. In the interest of balance, Diana also had her own fair share of affairs,  but she emerged from the divorce in a much more positive light than Charles.  And she stood on her own to feet. She was a public figure in her own right.  She became deeply involved in humanitarian courses, including raising awareness about aids and  campaigning against the use of landmines. She did things that no royal had previously done.  She hugged a man suffering from AIDS, which was hugely important in debunking the myth  that you could catch HIV through physical contact. She walked through a field of live landmines.  She had a warmth, a progibility and humanity that no member of the royal family had previously shown.  and you could reasonably argue, has shown sins.  Our warmth and charisma made her the so-called People's Princess,  loved by millions around the world. She had this rare ability to connect with people,  particularly the vulnerable and marginalized, and this made her immeasurably popular at home and abroad.  But this popularity came at a price. She was relentlessly pursued by the press in a way that  no royal before and after ever has been. The tabloids followed her every move, and the  public's fascination with her personal life, her relationships and her charity work was  insatiable. She was constantly hounded by photographers, and the scrutiny was so intense  Diana publicly spoke out in a TV interview about how difficult it was to live under the  media's microscope and how she felt that she lived in a goldfish bowl. It was this obsession  with photographing her, as we'll come on to talk about in a minute, that some people said  ultimately led to her tragic death. So what was happening in the lead up to the crash? Why was Diana  in Paris that night, and what role did the paparazzi play in it all?  Diana and Dodie Fayette had only met six weeks before, but it was a whirlwind romance.  They spent the summer of 1997 together, travelling on Dodie's father's yacht in the Mediterranean,  and staying at his family's villa in the south of France.  Although it had only been going on for a few weeks, their relationship had captured the  attention of the press, and speculation was rampant about whether the couple were about  to announce an engagement.  On the evening of August 30th, they ate at the restaurant of the Ritz Hotel in Paris,  which was owned by Dodys Farber, Mohammed Alphayette.  After dinner, they decided to leave and head back to Daudi's apartment before leaving for  London the following morning.  The problem was, as always, the hordes of paparazzi waiting eagerly outside the hotel,  knowing that Diana and Daudi would have to leave eventually.  But Daudi had a plan to throw them off to trick them.  A decoy car was sent to the front of the rits, while Diana and Dody slipped out through  a secret door at the back of hotel and into the Mercedes.  But the planned didn't work, they were spotted.  The paparazzi were soon on their tail chasing the car through the streets of Paris.  This takes us back to that tunnel, to the faithful moment when Aoi Paul lost control and  and the car smashed into a pillar.  In the immediate aftermath of the news, there was an almost national sense of bereavement  in the UK.  An estimated 1 million people travelled to London to pay their respects to her, leaving  bouquets of flowers and letters of condolence, outside Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace,  her private residence.  The news was full of interviews with members of the public in tears, people who had never  met Diana, but felt like they had lost a loved one of their own, a wife, mother or sister.  And Britain isn't known to be a nation of people who are particularly comfortable with  their emotions.  You might know the term stiff upper lip, which is this idea that it is honrable to avoid  showing any emotion, even in times of great sadness and despair.  But something was different.  They were men, women and children in tears at the loss of this woman they had never met.  Commentators would later point to it as a defining moment in British history.  A time when people in Britain became comfortable with displaying their emotions.  For one family in Britain, however, there was no such emotional awakening.  The royal family was staying at Balmoral Castle, its large country estate in Scotland.  There were some token public statements put out in the press, but the Queen and the wider  royal family were criticized for what was interpreted as a cold and emotionless reaction,  especially compared to the outpouring of grief from the general public.  Anna's funeral took place a week after her death, on September 6th, and was watched by an  estimated 2.5 billion people across the world. If you are one of them, you might remember that  her sons, the then 12 and 15 year old Harry and William, walked behind the funeral procession,  together with Prince Charles, Prince Philip and Diana's brother, the Earl of Spencer.  The inclusion of the boys in the funeral procession was highly contentious and was criticized  by many as showing an utter lack of compassion.  After all, these were two boys who had just lost their mother and they were being forced  to grieve in front of a live crowd of millions and billions more watching on TV.  Unsurprisingly, Prince William would later say that walking behind his mother's coffin  was one of the hardest things that he has ever done.  As you may remember, the guest-list at the funeral service itself was a veritable who's  who of notable figures.  World leaders, past and present, kings and queens, musicians, Hollywood actors and directors.  They had initially been concerns that the funeral shouldn't have been held in Westminster  Abby, a large cathedral in London, partly because there wouldn't have been enough guests  to fill it.  These concerns were clearly unfounded.  Every seat was filled, and an estimated two and a half million people descended on the  streets of London to pay their respects.  In the weeks and months afterwards, questions started to be asked about who was to blame,  and whether her death could have been prevented.  Was it simply a tragic accident or whether other forces at play?  Ma-Mid-Al-Fayette, Dodie's father, pointed the finger directly at the royal family, and  made the shocking accusation that Diana and his son were murdered in a plot orchestrated  by the British establishment.  Then he pointed the finger at O'Rei-Boul, the driver.  As tests later revealed, he had been drinking alcohol, and he was four times the legal  limit.  In other words, he was drunk, he crashed, and that's the end of it.  Others lay the blame squarely with the paparazzi, arguing that their pursuit had forced  O'Rei-Boul to drive a reckless speeds to avoid them.  The paparazzi had never given her an inch of privacy, and to her last breath had used  her as a product to squeeze money out of.  And in one final display of the transactional nature of the paparazzi's relationship  with Diana, as she lay dying in the wreckage of the car, instead of trying to help in  some way, or giving the paramedics the privacy to try to save her life.  of the press jumped onto the roof of the car and continued to take photos of the critically  injured woman. It was the paparazzi that ultimately bore responsibility, so the argument goes.  Our people might have been drunk, but he wouldn't have been driving so fast if the car wasn't  being pursued by the paparazzi. And this is not just a theory, it's not just someone's argument.  There was a lengthy official inquest into the death, which concluded that, and I'm quoting  directly, Diana was unlawfully killed by the grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles,  meaning the paparazzi, and of the Mercedes driver, Ori-Paul.  In other words, if she hadn't been followed by the paparazzi, and if Ori-Paul had been  sober, she would still be alive today.  and going one level further up, some lay the blame at the feet of the public, the people  who bought the newspapers and magazines that paid the paparazzi for their photos.  A single picture of Diana could go for 500,000 pounds, more than a million euros in today's  money.  So, it's hardly surprising that the paparazzi chased her so relentlessly.  It is us, the public, who must bear some of the responsibility for endlessly buying the magazines  with paparazzi pictures of Diana and for having such an insatiable appetite to consume  every last detail and picture of the private life of someone who is a vulnerable and lonely  woman struggling to repair her life after a nasty public divorce.  Now, it has been more than 25 years since the events of that fateful evening in Paris.  Her sons have grown up, married and had children of their own.  They both, reportedly, have a visceral, hatred and distrust of the press, especially the British  tabloid press.  And who can blame them?  The official verdict was that their mother's death was unlawfully caused first by the paparazzi,  And out the paparazzi, these two men would still have a mother.  Their children would have a grandmother.  To wrap things up, perhaps the question to leave you with is to ask what has been learned  from Diana's tragic death.  It highlighted the dark side of fame and the extreme consequences of a relentless press.  But did it change anything?  More than 25 years later, her story still serves as a powerful reminder of the human  cost behind the headlines.  Okay then, that is it for today's episode on the death of Princess Diana.  I hope it's been an interesting one and that you've learned something new.  You've been listening to English learning for curious minds by Leonardo English.  I'm Alice Debudge, you stay safe and I'll catch you in the next episode.
