I was at a party last month and this song came on.  She take my money!  And you know normally,  Well I'm in need!  My first impulse with this song was to just get my eagle on.  Oh, you give me money!  But I really did not understand how the DJ didn't get the memo.  Hmm.  So I just stood there on the dance floor, not dancing.  What did you want to happen?  I just wanted to not have to think about him.  Right.  You just wanted to enjoy the night.  Yeah, I just wanted to enjoy the night.  This was me just like running out of runway to let this person's ideology fly.  If we can even call it an ideology.  But mostly what I was feeling out there on the dance floor was just like another occasion  occasion for me to sit in my blackness and figure out what that is all about.  It's tough, right?  It's really frustrating and it's difficult to try to figure out our relationship to someone  we don't even know.  But who we work, we've had a relationship to for decades.  So thinking about divesting from that is...  It's painful.  It's not a small thing.  No, it's huge.  And it's so huge that I have to be done.  Now when I say done, I don't mean I'm going to come after people who play the music in  my presence.  I just think that I, Wesley Morris, am done trying to make a kind of intellectual sense  Yeah.  Of the artist formerly known as Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.  Mm-hmm.  I just, it's written deeply vile territory.  And I can't make intellectual sense of that.  I'm where you're at.  I'm past the point of sadness.  Yes, yes.  And into a place of rage.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Discomfort.  And historically speaking,  there has been a lot of grace for Ye.  Probably more than he actually deserved,  and I'm thinking about choosing to associate  with Donald Trump and going to Trump Tower.  There has been mounting misogyny,  mounting sexism that got overlooked,  got to pass because the music was so good.  Now we're reaching a point where all that's compounding,  the list is very long, includes the White Lives Matter shirt,  Paris Fashion Week, this up-horn interview  he gives most recently on Alex Jones' show.  I'm not gonna repeat what he said  because it's way too vile.  There's no redemption.  There's no accountability.  Every single time this person is given a chance,  including being allowed back on Twitter.  They just double down.  You know, you and I have talked about Kanye  many, many, many times over the course of the show.  The last time we tried to untangle this topic together,  we decided together, we were not gonna give up on Kanye,  that we were invested in him and his project  and his mission and curious about it.  A day has arrived where how we feel is different.  Yeah.  So let's get into it, let's talk about it,  and also just notice how the atmosphere  in this room has changed.  Yeah.  It's always a party in the studio.  Yeah.  Today it's funerial.  Let's talk about why.  I'm Jay Wortham.  I'm Wesley Morris and we're two cultural undertakers at The New York Times.  And this is still processing.  Can we go back to 2004?  Take me there.  2004, the college dropout comes out.  And I was really feeling like here was a person I had kind of been waiting for.  This guy was iconic plastic in his insistence that there are rules that you don't have to  follow to become a successful black person.  Wow.  He drops out of college the year I graduate.  And one of the things we get taught as a people is that one of the things that really helps  us succeed is going to get a college degree.  And there was something about its mocking insistence that it's the wrong way to go.  There's a whole sketch.  My dad died and he left me his degrees.  Where the narrator of this little interlude is basically talking about a story where  his father collects degrees essentially.  My mom would always say, Dad, why don't you work?  But he just kept learning.  You know, he wasn't a good father as a result.  Had all these degrees.  He was so greedy with degrees, he took my degree.  But I just kind of sat there and was like,  for a lot of us, this is a way out.  It's getting a college education.  It feels important to note  that at this exact same moment in time,  Another college dropout is releasing something  that will also disrupt notions of productivity and genius  and introduce an entirely new paradigm,  which is Mark Zuckerberg, famous college dropout,  launches the facebook.com.  And I just bring that up to say that album for me  also challenged the idea that the other means of success  was to somehow figure out how to be a really savvy college  dropout who created a multi-million dollar app that  then sky rockets you to stardom and success,  because that was the pressure for my generation  at that time, right?  It was this idea of we are at the forefront  of a brand new technological revolution,  and if you can't figure it out, you're  going to be left behind.  And Kanye college dropout just also offered a way  to say unsubscribe.  Maybe I don't want that either.  But the way I received aspects of the College Dropout album  was that he was essentially challenging  what I can only describe as like a black orthodoxy  that points to middle class black success  as looking a particular way.  I didn't have a problem with that.  That wasn't an, it didn't feel like an orthodoxy to me,  But the way that Kanye West was thinking about it, it was.  What I found so moving about Kanye's alternativeness  is that he was still a scholar.  And instead of someone presenting papers or dissertations,  what he was doing was he was presenting lineage  through music, right, through sampling.  You know, part of Kanye's early success  resides entirely in his uncanny and genius-like  ability to beatmatch.  And pull tiny snippets and choruses and parts of songs.  And step on them, screw them, smash them.  So they sound completely different and also extremely  familiar.  And some people call that production,  But I also call that archive work because what you're doing is pulling from the past to make something new for the future.  It's a way of honoring your musical lineage.  It's a way of honoring your musical ancestors, giving them their flowers in real time.  And a key example of that craftsmanship shines on all falls down.  This is the real one, baby.  I'm telling you I love you.  This is our dance fan.  Which is pulled from Lauren Hill's  devastatingly iconic, unplugged,  2002 MTV Live performance.  Oh, when did all old phones die?  Telling you old.  And she's really talking about  about the corrosiveness of fame, the music industry, sexism.  By the way, Kanye actually didn't get permission  to use the original sample,  but he ends up bringing a Chicago singer in,  Selena Johnson, to sing the hooks that he uses.  So it's an interpolation of Lauren Hill's album,  but that's a way of, again, referencing an artist  that at that time a lot of people weren't thinking about.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Where is the where?  Where is the where?  I'm also thinking of a song like Heard Him Say,  which includes this just incredibly delicate  and lacy piano work.  Yeah.  And I heard him say,  nothing's ever promised him all the day.  That's a sample from a Natalie Cole song.  There's someone in this world  that I'll always choose to love.  His work with sampling and production  was really, really, really validating  to think about musical artistry  and deep archival knowledge as being just as important  as anything else you might study in college.  And the music was fun.  It was fun to listen to.  And what was really exciting about that was that  the art seemed free, the person who made the art seemed free,  the sort of personal freedom to be whoever Kanye West  the individual is.  And if that happens to lead to thinking in a way that isn't like other black people,  most black people, then so be it.  He was the latest black American artist to find a way to express in his own way what  freedom could sound like.  to Kanye at least gave me hope that someone is thinking about another way.  So to have someone like Kanye come out very boldly and exuberantly and to say, I'm creating  my own politic, it has nothing to do with what the huckstables were up to.  Because that's what we're really also talking about here right now, which is a black paradigm  that had been set up and created by the huckstables.  And here's someone else saying, I don't know, I think there's another way.  of my people down there. So anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with.  This is also the period where he goes on that hurricane Katrina telethon.  There's now over 25 feet of water where there was once city streets.  And stands next to Mike Myers and says, George Bush doesn't care about black people.  He looked terrified when he did it. And that moment made him a folk hero, essentially.  he was expressing feelings that a lot of black people in this country felt about the president  at that time. And after these first three albums, the next three, 808s and Heartbreak,  and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy, and Jesus have some of that vulnerability to me.  Like he is he's risking something here in terms of how big he wants to make his ego  How small he wants to make it? I think those are three albums that are there are about a person wrestling with something else  There is during this what I would describe as a vulnerability period this turn into darkness into grimness  And the whole time one of the one of the thrills of these albums is it as a listener  You're kind of like your hand is near the panic button,  even as the music is kind of blowing your mind.  It seemed like for Kanye during this time,  that as he became more successful,  the initial disruption that he created, right,  and the freedom that that allowed him,  perhaps was starting to trap him, right?  I'm thinking really specifically about that 2013  Zane Lowe interview, where he's asked about the song on Yeezus titled I Am a God.  It's a very fast-paced, aggressive song that just felt like an exorcism of some kind,  and I honestly didn't really grapple with the lyrics too much. And then you have him in this  interview where he's like, everybody says, who does he think he is? I just told you who I thought  I was a god. And that part of the interview is always excerpted as an example of this turn  you're describing where we're seeing an artist who's wrestling with inner demons that aren't yet  fully outside of themselves in a way like it's very internal conflict but that interview goes on  and what he says next is so illuminating he's like would it been better if I had a son is  that I'm a gangster or if I had a son to say I'm a pimp.  Because society is a lot more comfortable  with me describing myself in those terms.  But when I say I'm a God, that's when people have a problem.  But there is this sense of someone who feels  like they're not being recognized for how great they are.  And that's a really different approach  than early Kanye, which is talking about,  I don't care what you think about me.  I'm gonna carve a new path, I'm a blaze a new way,  Follow me if you want, whatever.  And this Kanye is saying,  you do not recognize me for how great I am.  And there's a marked difference there.  Yeah.  And he goes on tour, the Life of Pablo tour.  It's 2016.  And he's giving these erratic speeches from the stage.  And there's a horrible assault robbery incident  involving Kim Kardashian.  And during the tour, he is hospitalized with exhaustion.  And the first thing that he does  when he gets out of the hospital  is go to Trump Tower.  And it wasn't just that he goes to Trump Tower  a month after the election.  He goes blonde.  A hair color that basically matches Donald Trump's.  Just friends, just friends, and it's a good man.  And the press is trying to ask Yeh questions,  and he doesn't answer.  Yeh just stands there.  Mm.  The president wants to be right,  but there's nothing to say.  I just want to take a picture right now.  And that was the beginning of some kind of change.  Like, I mean, it was not the beginning,  that was the culmination to me of an evolution  towards something that felt unsavory  and potentially dangerous.  all the things you're describing Wesley  is actually why I decided to go see St. Pablo, right?  The tour for the life of Pablo  because that album was so confounding to me, right?  You have a song like,  Ultra Light Beam, which is kind of about redemption.  You've got Kirk Franklin.  Father, this prayer is for everyone  that feels they're not good enough.  The expert on black redemption in our community and gospel.  singing the song with chance about new beginnings and hope and optimism.  And that song goes right into Father Stretch My Hands Part 1.  And then he starts talking about...  Which I don't have world judgment around, but in the context of the key changes of the song  is really befuddling.  So with all this in mind, me and Good Faith get a ticket,  go to St. Pablo concert.  I think I went by myself.  And I was struck by a few things.  One, the entire concert pretty much  was attended by white people.  There was something interesting there.  The stage mechanics of that performance,  Kani was suspended on a platform  that was shrouded in light.  So much so that you couldn't see the audience.  I mean, this is always true of a concert, right?  The performer is highlighted.  But usually, there are these roving spotlights on the crowd  so you can see everyone else in their state of ecstasy  and you're getting off of their giddiness.  And with Kanye, there really wasn't any interest  in being able to see the audience.  All eyes were on Kanye.  And the platform was careening around the arena.  Yeah, it was cantilevered.  And so the people below it were shrouded in darkness  so you could only just see this teeming mass of Kanye's  acolytes essentially reaching their hands up.  I mean, it looked like a Caravaggio painting or something.  It had very gothic elements to it.  I'd say Bosch.  Heronimus Bosch.  Ha ha ha.  Oh.  It just felt really clear that  Kanye's self rendering  was completely transformed.  Mm-hmm.  and that where he was, we weren't meant to access.  One of the things that you and I  have been thinking about together  in our work separately  is what does ultimate absolute freedom  for black people in this country look like?  One of the things that seemed like  EA was trying to show us was maybe it does look like  for Republicans, if you are conservative,  you should be free enough to do that.  Why shouldn't you be able to go on Twitter  and with a MAGA hat on, and well, I don't see,  why shouldn't I be able to do this?  Because I'm me.  I'm not representing black people, I'm representing me.  Yay.  Okay, but well, I don't think that's freedom.  It's not an expansive idea.  It's not an idea that's actually imagining something new.  And I'm drawing a lot of my thinking from a book that has really been moving me in my own research for my projects called The Long Emancipation by Renato Walcott, which is trying to help us distinguish between ideas of emancipation and freedom.  Yeah.  His point is that emancipation served as a way to think about not slavery.  But it wasn't freedom, right?  Because the newly emancipated black people in this country still had a ton.  I mean, we still do, but there was a ton of socio-political restrictions and limitations on what kind of jobs you could have.  Where you could live.  Policing on your hair, policing on your body.  I mean, we have an approximation of freedom,  but because we're still in this post-slavery economy,  it's really hard to know what it would actually mean  to be free.  And so the book is asking us to think about  being in a long period of emancipation  rather than ever having approached freedom.  I want that freedom for all of us.  I just have a really hard time believing that a true expression of freedom comes at the  expense of other people's safety, other people's humanities, and other people's sense of dignity.  Well that's the point at which his going to Paris during Paris Fashion Week and wearing  the t-shirt that says white lives matter comes in, right?  Not just that all lives matter, that would have been bad enough.  But he were sure this had white lives matter.  Talking about like, I'm going to go death con three, death con three, DEA, TH, con three  on Jewish people.  For me, that was the moment where, I mean, all the wheels fall off.  The wheels had been falling off the bus for a minute though, right?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  It's important to remember that Kanye has been practicing Miss Algenor for a really  long time.  Songs like Gold Digger, right?  Even songs like Flashing Lights.  There's always this narrative that just paints him as a victim to greedy black women.  And the entire narrative around Amber Rose and the aftermath of their relationship, he  just painted her as this opportunistic, greedy little slut.  and he had to take 30 showers after he broke up with her.  And that was on the radio and everybody laughed.  The culture was just like, yeah, who cares about her?  I'm probably as guilty as anybody.  We all are.  I mean, we're talking about this cultural complacency  and our role in helping create this social monster  that we have today.  So there had already been a lot of corrosive behavior  towards a lot of vulnerable people  before all of this blew up in the last handful of months.  Well, I mean, I think we should take a break.  And when we come back, we should talk about exactly  how blown up things are because  whatever seemed free about this person  is actually the opposite. <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> My name is Audra D.

I'm not inside that man's brain.  I'm not inside anybody's head but my own.  What's coming up for me in all of this is that this is not the first time we have been  here as a people.  Other people have made this choice to try to challenge what we initially were calling  an orthodoxy, right?  But what it really is, is our sense of community.  One of the earliest people who comes to mind is a guy named George Schuyler, wrote one  of my favorite books, it's called Black No More, that came out in 1931.  And it's basically about a scientist who creates a way for black people to become white.  And the main character undergoes this procedure, turns from a black person to a white person,  and becomes a big wig in a white supremacist organization that's kind of like the KKK,  marries the daughter of the head clansman who is trying to stop this race-changing  procedure from making things worse for white people.  How does the technology impact your DNA?  Well, funny you should ask because whenever in this novel, a black person who's turned  white reproduces with their new white spouse, they produce a black baby.  Right, right.  That was my question.  The DNA, don't lie.  And that's the point of the satire, right?  But at some point, everybody's confused about everything in this book, including I would  say George Schuyler.  who in the years after its publication becomes increasingly conservative and increasingly  anti-black.  You know, he released his statements like condemning Martin Luther King as being nothing  more than a huckster.  And then let's just fast forward to Clarence Thomas, who begins his intellectual life as  a black nationalist and winds up on the Supreme Court as what, as far as I can see, is its  most conservative member, and he's been on the court longer than anybody at this point.  And essentially, his jurisprudence amounts to casting a vote against every piece of civil  rights legislation that comes to the court, racial equity, racial fairness, racial justice.  And the reason to bring George Schuyler and Clarence Thomas into our conversation about  Kanye West J is just to, how could they express their own beliefs as individual Americans?  And what happens when those beliefs don't necessarily correspond with the majority of  black Americans?  Does that mean that the rest of us are sheep?  that these are the free thinkers or are they what, you know,  classically gets called Uncle Tom's?  Because all that alleged free thinking just winds up  doing more harm to people, black people, Jews, I mean,  all people.  We've been talking about this in terms of freedom,  but I wonder if it's a question of their imaginations, right?  The imagination is so limited.  I mean, I've been thinking so much in our conversation  about Robin G. Kelly's book, Freedom Dreams,  where he tries to go back and chronicle  what black activists have been doing  to try to imagine their ways out of  the constraints that we're in, right?  That we're trying to go someplace we've never been before  and new tools and tactics are required.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  True liberation really does involve the imagination  because we can't see what we don't know yet.  And I think that's why I keep coming back  to this idea of how limited this imagination is.  To talk about violence, whether it's against women  you've dated, people you feel you're in competition to,  is so unimaginative and boring and completely uninteresting.  interesting, in addition to it just being completely unacceptable.  That's what discounts Kanye for me.  The problem is the closer it got to white supremacy, the less interesting the art became.  As long as you're out there trying to align a white lives matter t-shirt with an artistic  practice, your art is run aground.  Art is run out of anything interesting or new to say.  Right.  The turning point for me around Kanye, though, was  him lashing out at the Vogue editor.  Around the same time.  Around the same time.  That the White Lives Matter shirts happened.  I was watching it unfold on Instagram Stories.  So I was watching along with Vogue contributing editor,  Gabriela Carifa Johnson, who was at that show in October.  And you know, she said, to promote these ideas  and white supremacist ideology on a fashion show  and loop in black people to also promote it, she's saying,  is a very scary and dangerous and violent thing.  She was just like, this isn't art. This isn't good art.  And Kanye immediately singled her out.  He posted a picture of her.  He mocked her clothes. He mocked her shoes.  I mean, this is someone who has millions and millions of people following him  and to direct the fire hose of that attention.  This black woman is a very scary and unsettling thing to do.  And immediately, so many people jump to her defense.  People are posting, talking about her right to express her critique and criticism  as a Vogue editor at Fashion Week.  That's literally what they're sent there to do.  do and what ends up happening is a meeting between all of them is arranged and then Kanye  tweets out like we're good now this is my sister.  Yeah.  It's just chaos.  I think what we're, I mean, I think the other other thing we're talking about is this other  race of people.  What?  They're called famous people.  Oh yeah.  Fame is a race.  Yeah, it is.  I mean, if black, white, you know, those are all constructs.  This one is too.  So is fame.  And at some point, I think famous people  really think that their fame and power  entitles them. And money, you're talking about money.  Like money is the thing that undergrads all this too.  Yes.  And I think all those things entitle people  to say and do whatever it is they want.  Maybe Kanye isn't black.  Maybe he's just famous in his mind.  What do you mean by that?  I mean that the story that it would seem  that he can tell himself is that  it's the George Schuyler story.  It's the Black No More story.  I have moved over to this other side  And I think it's pretty great.  Mm.  Look at me.  I just put a bunch of people in white lives matter t-shirts  and sent them out at a fashion show.  Mm.  I mean, what black person would think to do that?  Me.  You and I arrived in strangely different places.  Like the way I'm orienting myself right now  is I'm trying to ask of myself different questions  as a consumer, as a cultural critic,  as a thinker, like I am really trying to assess  what in me let me overlook those things for so long.  And how can I pay that attention forward?  Who are some of the artists, creators, thinkers,  producers right now who deserve some of that energy, right?  I'm thinking about Thames, F&F,  I'm thinking of a ton of incredibly talented  black women artists who are coming up right now  who are geniuses.  And I'm just trying to do my own reparative work  and understand how I can do better differently, right?  Because I recognize that I'm part of the economy  that gave Kanye permission for so long  because I'm not gonna be able to change Kanye.  I can't ask him to show up differently.  I can't even, you know,  the only work I can do is really analyze my own priorities  and interests and curiosities.  I think the thing that has brought us together  to talk about this is not that it is happening  or that it is new.  I think the reason that for many of us,  the problem presented by this person is personal.  personal. I mean, it's individually personal, right? Like the thing about college dropout  that so bothered me was that I received it as an indictment, not actually of getting  an education. I received it as an indictment of getting an education with white people.  He doesn't say any of that on the album, but I went to Yale. The numbers just made it so  that most of my friends were white. And one of the things that we black people talked  about a lot was what it's going to mean to then have these relationships, these close  friendships with white people.  The fear I felt was that I would get to this school and get this education, but that it  was going to cost me something.  And the price was going to be my blackness.  know, I live a life among white people.  There are white people in my life.  There have been white people in my bed.  I've never, ever, ever felt in danger of losing my sense of who I am as a black American person.  But I've always worried and wondered simultaneously why.  Why am I not making the same choices Kanye West made?  Mm-hmm  He's got stage 4 cancer of the thing that I am a hypochondriac about  You know what I'm thinking of right now  You know in the walking dead when they go to the CDC this is like pretty early on  It's probably season one. I bear my soul you pulled out the walking dead. Okay, but listen hear me out. Hear me out  I'm here. Hold on. Okay. Okay  Early on in AMC is the walking dead.  Someone gets the idea that we should go to the CDC because that's where all the answers will be.  They make their way there and they realize that the virus that turns people into zombies after they've been killed  is in all of them.  That all of them are actually already infected.  There is no the infected.  It only activates after you're dead.  And it's a heart-crushing episode because you realize that the cure they'd been looking for doesn't really seem to exist.  And everyone at any moment has the potential to become accountable, to turn on themselves really first and then everyone else around them.  So, I'm listening to you talk and I'm thinking about this way in which this fear that there  could be something latent inside of all of us that turns us unrecognizable and that also  is related to white supremacy, you know?  We all grow up in this world, you know?  It's all in the water.  And what's between you and me and someone like Kanye is mental health issues, right?  A lot of money, a lot of enabling, and a lot of self-loathing and an economy that's not  stopping you.  But yeah, the worry that somehow we'll lose track of ourselves, that's a real fear and  It's not unfounded.  The fear that I have is that what you so beautifully encapsulated  as being a latent possibility in all of us.  It's so depressing and infuriating to watch it proliferate in somebody else.  I mean, we haven't even talked about really the fact that Kanye West  is not well and no one knows what to do about that unwellness.  And it makes me think about Amy Winehouse.  It makes me think about a certain era of Britney Spears' life.  When someone's spiral that feels like it's approaching a death spiral is just tabloid fodder.  There's an attention economy, which is why people are talking about divesting from  Kanye and just stopping paying attention.  Stop paying attention.  But what I'm also hearing you say is that the real freedom in this scenario is our freedom to leave him out there.  Yeah.  I mean, it's sad. It's really, really sad.  And the only power that we have as a society is just to say, like, we do not tolerate this.  And we don't condone this.  And that's where we're at with Kanye.  But I do think that it's not about leaving Kanye.  It's about leaving someone who is completely unwilling to be  accountable for the harms they're causing.  And that the only way to inoculate ourselves.  I was thinking about an infection.  from its spreading is to quarantine ourselves.  It hurts.  It does.  That's our show.
