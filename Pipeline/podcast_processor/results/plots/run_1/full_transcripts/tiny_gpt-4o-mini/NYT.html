I was at a party last month and the song came on.  She'd take the money and you know normally, well I'm a knee-heat.  My first impulse with the song is to just get my eagle on.  But I really did not understand how the DJ didn't get the memo.  So I just did there.  On the dance floor, not dancing.  did you want to happen?  I just wanted to not have to think about him.  That's right.  You just wanted to do it the night.  Yeah, I just wanted to enjoy the night.  This was me just like running out of runway  to let this person's ideology fly.  If we can even call it an ideology.  But mostly what I was feeling out there on the dance floor  was just like another occasion for me to sit in my blackness  and figure out what that is all about.  It's tough, right?  It's really frustrating and it's difficult  to try to figure out our relationship  to someone we don't even know,  but who's working, how to relationship to for decades.  So thinking about divesting from that is painful.  It's not a small thing.  No, it's huge.  And it's so huge that I have to be done.  Mm-hmm.  Now, when I say done, I don't mean,  I'm going to come after people who play the music in my presence.  I just think that I Wesley Morris am done trying to  make a kind of intellectual sense of the artist  formerly known as Kanye West who now goes by yay.  I just, it's, we're in deeply vile territory.  And I can't make intellectual sense of that.  I'm where you're at.  I'm past the point of sadness.  Yes, yes.  Into a place of rage.  This comfort and historically speaking, there has been a lot of grace for  right probably more than he actually deserved it. I'm thinking about choosing to associate  with Donald Trump and going to Trump Tower. There has been mounting misogyny, mounting sexism that  got overlooked, got a pass because the music was so good. Now we're reaching a point where  all that's compounding, the list is very long includes the White Lives Matter shirt, Paris Fashion Week,  this Apporn interview he gives most recently on Alex Jones Show, I'm not gonna repeat what he said  because it's way too vile, there's no redemption.  There's no accountability.  Every single time this person has given a chance,  including being allowed back on Twitter.  Neja's double down.  You and I have talked about Kanye many, many, many times  over the course of the show.  The last time we tried to untangle this topic together,  we decided together, we were not gonna give up on Kanye,  that we were invested in him and his project  his mission and curious about it.  A day has arrived where how we feel is different.  Yeah.  So let's get into it.  Let's talk about it.  And also just notice how the atmosphere in this room has changed.  Yeah.  It's always a party in this studio.  Yeah.  Today it's funerary.  Let's talk about why.  I'm Jayworthum.  I'm Wesley Morris and we're two cultural undertakers at the New York Times.  And this is still processing.  Can we go back to 2004?  Take me there.  2004, the college dropout comes out.  And I was really feeling like here was a person I had kind of been waiting for.  Wow.  This guy was a conicalastic in his insistence that  that there are rules that you don't have to follow to become a successful black person.  Wow. He drops out of college the or I graduate and one of the things we get taught as a people  is that one of the things that really helps us succeed is going to get a college degree.  And there was something about it's mocking insistence that it's the wrong way to go.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha  But I just kind of sat there and was like for a lot of us, this is a way out.  It's getting a college education.  It feels important to note that at this exact same moment in time, another college  dropout is releasing something that will also disrupt notions of productivity, ingenious  and, you know, introducing entirely new paradigm, which is Mark Zuckerberg, famous college  drop out launches the Facebook.com. And I just bring that up to say that album for me also challenged  the idea that the other means of success was to somehow figure out how to be a really savvy  college dropout who created a multi-million dollar app that then skyrocketed you to start  them in success because that was the pressure for my generation at that time, right? It was this  idea of we are at the forefront of a brand new technological revolution and if you can't  figure it out you're going to be left behind. And Kanye College dropout just also offered  a way to say unsubscribe. Maybe I don't want that either. But the way I received aspects of  the college dropout album was that you was essentially challenging what I can only describe as  like a black orghtedoxy that points to middle-class black success as looking a particular  way.  I didn't have a problem with that.  That wasn't an or I didn't feel like an orthodoxy to me.  But the way that Kanye West was thinking about it, it was.  What I found so moving about Kanye's alternativeness is that he was still a scholar.  instead of someone presenting papers or dissertations what he was doing was he was presenting  lineage through music right through sampling. You know part of Kanye's early success  resides entirely in his uncanny and genius like ability to meet match  and hold tiny snippets and choruses and parts of songs  I just need to clear my mind.  And step on them, screw them, smash them.  So they sound completely different and also extremely familiar.  And some people call that production,  but I also call that archive work because what you're doing is pulling  from the past to make something new for the future.  It's a way of honoring your musical lineage.  It's a way of honoring your musical ancestors, giving them  flowers in real time and a key example of that craftsmanship shines on all falls down.  Which is pulled from Lauren Hills. Do you have a  have a Statingly iconic, unplugged 2002 MTV Live Performance.  And she's really talking about the  co-rosiveness of fame, the music industry, sexism.  By the way, Connie actually didn't get permission to use the original sample,  but he ends up bringing a Chicago singer in Selena Johnson to sing,  The hugs that he uses so it's an interpolation of Lauren Hill's album, but that's a way of  again referencing an artist that at that time a lot of people weren't thinking about.  I'm also thinking of a song like, Hurtem Say, which includes this just incredibly delicate and  Lise Piano work.  And I heard him say nothing's ever promised to  model today.  That's sample from a Natalie Colson.  I'm one in this world that I long ways to  love.  His work with sampling and production was really,  really, really validating to think about  musical artistry and deep archival knowledge as being just as important as  anything else he might study in college.  And the music was fun. It was fun to listen to.  And what was really exciting about that was that the art seemed free, the person who made  the art seemed free, the sort of personal freedom to be whoever Kanye West the individual is.  And if that happens to lead to thinking in a way that isn't like other black people,  most black people, then so be it.  He was the latest black American artist to find a way to express in his own way what freedom  could sound like.  Listening to Kanye at least gave me hope that someone is thinking about another way.  So to have someone like Kanye come out very boldly and exuberantly and to say,  I'm creating my own politics and has nothing to do with what the Hugs to Bulls were up to.  Because that's what we're really also talking about here right now, which is a black paradigm  that had been set up and created by the Hugs to Bulls. And here's someone I'll say,  I don't know, I think there's another way.  Those are my people down, I said anybody out there  that wants to do anything that we can help with.  This is also the period where he goes on that hurricane Katrina,  telephone.  There's now over 25 feet of water where there was one city streets.  And Stan's next to Mike Myers and says,  George Bush doesn't care about black people.  He looked terrified when he did it.  And that moment made him a folk hero, essentially.  He was expressing feelings that a lot of black people in this country felt about the president at that time.  And after these first three albums, the next three,  eight o'clock in the heartbreak and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy, and Jesus,  have some of that vulnerability to me.  Like he is risking something here in terms of how big he wants to make his ego, how small  he wants to make it.  I think those are three albums that are about a person wrestling with something else.  There is during this, what I would describe as a vulnerability period, this turn into darkness  and degrimness.  And the whole time, one of the, one of the thrills of these albums is that as a listener,  You're kind of like, your hand is near the panic button,  even as the music is kind of blowing your mind.  It seemed like for Kanye during this time  that as he became more successful,  the initial disruption that he created, right?  And the freedom that that allowed him,  perhaps we'll start into trapping, right?  I'm thinking really specifically about that 2013  Zain low interview, where he's asked about the song on  he's as titled I am a gods.  It's a very fast, pace aggressive song.  That just felt like an exercise of some kind,  and I honestly didn't really grapple with the lyrics too much.  And then you have him in this interview, where he's like,  everybody says, who does he think he is?  I just told you who I thought I was.  Oh God.  And that part of the interview is always accepted as an example of this turn you're describing  where we're seeing an artist who's wrestling with inner demons that aren't yet fully  outside of themselves in a way.  Like it's very internal conflict.  But that interview goes on and what he says next is so illuminating.  He's like, would it been better if I had a son as I'm a gangster or if I had a son as  I'm a Pimp, because society is a lot more comfortable with me describing myself and those terms.  But when I say I'm a God, that's when people have a problem.  But there is this sense of someone who feels like they're not being recognized for how great they are.  And that's a really different approach than early Kanye, which is talking about,  I don't care what you think about me. I'm going to carve a new path. I'm a blaze of new way.  Follow me if you want whatever. And this Kanye is saying, you do not recognize me for how great I am and there's a marked difference there.  Yeah. And he goes on tour the life of Pablo towards 2016. And he's giving these erratic speeches from the stage.  And there's a horrible assault robbery incident involving Kim Kardashian.  And during the tour, he is hospitalized with exhaustion.  And the first thing that he does when he gets out of the hospital is go to Trump Tower.  power. And it wasn't just that he goes to Trump Tower a month after the election. He goes  blonde. I hear color that basically matches Donald Trump's. And the press is trying to ask  you a questions. And he doesn't answer. Gage is stands there. And that was the beginning.  of some kind of change.  Like, I mean, it was not the beginning.  That was the culmination to me of an evolution  toward something that felt unsavory  and potentially dangerous.  All the things you're describing Wesley  is actually why I decided to go see, say,  Pablo, right?  The tour for the life of Pablo,  because that album was so  confounding to me, right?  You have a song like Ultra Lightbeam,  which is kind of about redemption.  You've got Kirk Franklin.  Father, this press for everyone  the fills are not good enough.  The expert on Black Redemption, the Black community,  and gospel, singing the song with chance  about new beginnings and hope and optimism.  We wanna coach a leg game.  We wanna coach a leg game.  This is a God dream.  And that song goes right into Father Shrecht  my hands part one.  Beautiful morning, get a son of a morning fan.  And then he starts talking about,  I have my foot, this bottle, and she just bleached her ass off.  Which I don't have world judgment around,  but in the context of the key changes of the song  is really a funling.  So with all this had been, me and good faith  get a ticket, go to say in public concert.  I think I went by myself.  And I was struck by a few things.  One, the entire concert pretty much  was attended by white people.  There was something interesting there.  The stage mechanics of that performance,  Kanye was spending on a platform that was shrouded in light.  So much so that you couldn't see the audience.  I mean, this is always true of a concert, right?  The performer is highlighted.  But usually, there are these roving spotlights on the crowd.  So you can see everyone else in their state of ecstasy  and you're getting giddy off of their goodness  and the Kanye there really wasn't any interest  in being able to see the audience.  All eyes were on Kanye.  And the platform was cleaning around the arena.  Yeah, it was cantilevered.  And so the people below it were shrouded in darkness  so you could only just see this teeming mass of Kanye's  accolades essentially reaching their hands up.  I mean, it looked like a caravaggio painting  or something and had very gothic elements.  I'd say Bosch.  Heronum is Bosch.  It just felt really clear that Kanye's self-rendering was completely transformed.  And that where he was, we weren't meant to access.  One of the things that you and I have been thinking about together in our work separately  is what does ultimate absolute freedom for black people in this country look like?  One of the things that seemed like EA was trying to show us was maybe it does look like  voting for Republicans if you are conservative.  You should be free enough to do that.  I shouldn't you be able to go on Twitter and with a mag ahead on.  And well, I don't see why I shouldn't I be able to do this.  Because I'm me.  I'm not representing black people.  I'm representing me.  Yay.  Okay, but well, I don't think that's freedom.  It's not an expansive idea.  It's not an idea that's actually imagining something new.  And I'm drawing a lot of my thinking from a book that has really been moving me  in my own research for my projects,  called the Longamensipation by Renato Walcott,  which is trying to help us distinguish  between ideas of emancipation and freedom.  Yeah.  His point is that emancipation served as a way  to think about not slavery.  But it wasn't freedom, right?  Because the newly emancipated black people in this country  still had a ton, I mean, we still do.  But there was a ton of sociopolitical restrictions  and limitations on what kind of jobs you could have,  where you could live, policing on your hair,  policing on your body.  I mean, we have an approximation of freedom,  but because we're still in this post-slavery economy,  it's really hard to know what it would actually mean  to be free.  And so the book is asking us to think about  being in a long period of emancipation,  rather than ever having approached freedom.  I want that freedom for all of us.  I just have a really hard time believing  that a true expression of freedom  comes at the expense of other people's safety,  other people's humanities,  and other people's sense of dignity.  Well, that's the point at which  his going to Paris during Paris Fashion Week and wearing the t-shirt that says  white lives matter comes in, right? Not just that all lives matter. That would have  been bad enough. But he wore a shirt that said a white lives matter talking about  like I'm going to go deathcon 3 deathcon 3 D. E. A. T. H. Con 3 on Jewish people. For  For me, that was the moment where, I mean, all the wheels fall off.  The wheels had been fallen off the bus for a minute though, right?  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  It's important to remember that Kanye has been practicing misogyny  war for a really long time.  Songs like Golddigger, right?  Even songs like Flashing Lights, you know, there's always a narrative that just paints  him as a victim to greedy black women.  the entire narrative around Amber Rose.  A Lord.  In the aftermath of their relationship, he just  painted her as this opportunistic, greedy little  slut, and he had to take 30 showers after he broke  up with her.  And that was on the radio and everybody laughed.  The culture was just like, yeah, who cares about her?  I'm probably guilty as anybody.  We all are.  I mean, we're talking about this cultural complacency  and our role in helping create this social monster that we have today.  So there had already been a lot of corrosive behavior towards a lot of vulnerable people  before all of this blew up in the last handful of months.  Well, I mean, I think we should take a break and when we come back,  We should talk about exactly how blown up things are because whatever scene free about this person <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> is actually the opposite.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> My name is Audrey Diaz Burge and I am a national correspondent covering race and identity</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> for the New York Times.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> race coverage is complicated, it can be joyous and affirming, it can be uncomfortable, but</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> I feel like it's still absolutely necessary.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> Race and identity are not just understanding who you are, but who the person in front of</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> you is, and wanting to understand more about them.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> We're trying to wrestle down these really hard subjects, and maybe not answering the question,</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> but asking the right questions.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> And listening, listening.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> Listening a lot, the Times is dedicated to ambitious and deeply reported coverage of recent</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> identity and their willing to back it up with resources.</span> <span class="ad-highlight-ground-truth"> If you are curious about the world on which we live, if you're interested in who you</span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> are, where you come from and how you relate to others, I would encourage you to subscribe<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o-mini</span></span> <span class="ad-highlight-both ad-tooltip"> after the New York Times.<span class="ad-info">gpt-4o-mini</span></span>  It's hard to really talk about where I think Kanye is at.  And what I think is going on with him,  because the truth is I don't know.  I'm on inside that man's brain.  I'm not inside anybody's head, but my own.  What's coming up for me and all of this is that this is not the first time we have been here as a people.  Other people have made this choice to try to challenge what we initially were calling an Orthodoxy right?  But what it really is is our sense of community.  One of the earliest people who comes to mind is a guy named George Skyler.  wrote one of my favorite books is called Black No More.  Look at the came out in 1931.  And it's basically about a scientist who creates a way for black people to become white.  And the main character undergoes this procedure, turns from a black person to a white person.  And becomes a big wig in a white supremacist organization that's kind of like the KKK.  Mary's the daughter of the head,  Clansman, who is trying to stop this  race-changing procedure from making  things worse for white people.  How does the technology impact your DNA?  Well, funny, you should ask because whenever  in this novel, a black person who's turned  white reproduces with their new white spouse,  they produce a black baby.  Right, right. That's my question.  The DNA, don't lie.  And that's the point of the satire, right?  But at some point, everybody's confused about everything  in this book, including, I would say, George Skyler.  OK.  Who in the years after its publication  becomes increasingly conservative and increasingly  anti-black?  You know, he releases statements like condemning Martin Luther  King is being nothing more than a hoxster.  And then let's just fast forward to Clarence Thomas, who begins his intellectual life as a black nationalist.  And winds up on the Supreme Court as what, as far as I can see is it's most conservative member.  And he's been on the court longer than anybody at this point.  And essentially, his George Pyrdons amounts to casting a vote against every piece of civil rights legislation that comes to the court.  racial equity, racial fairness, racial justice.  And the reason to bring George Skyler and Clarence Thomas into our conversation about Kanye  West J is just to how could they express their own beliefs as individual Americans?  And what happens when those beliefs don't necessarily correspond with the majority of black Americans?  Does that mean that the rest of us are sheep and that these are the free thinkers?  Or are they what you know classically gets called uncle Tom's?  Because all that alleged free thinking just winds up doing more harm to  People black people Jews. I mean all people we've been talking about this in terms of freedom  But I wonder if it's a question of their imaginations  Right?  The imagination is so limited.  I mean, I've been thinking so much in our conversation  about Robin G. Kelly's book Freedom Dreams,  where he tries to go back and chronicle  what Black activists have been doing to try to imagine their ways  out of the constraints that were in.  That we're trying to go someplace we've never been before.  And new tools and tactics are required.  Yes, yes.  That true liberation really does involve  the imagination because we can't see what we don't know yet.  And I think that's why I keep coming back to this idea  of how limited this imagination is to talk about violence,  whether it's against women you've dated,  people you feel your incompetent to  is so unimaginative and boring and completely uninteresting  in addition to it just being completely unacceptable.  That's what discounts Kanye for me.  The problem is the closer it got to white supremacy,  the less interesting the art became.  Mm-hmm.  As long as you're out there,  trying to align a white-lives matter t-shirt  with an artistic practice,  your art is run aground.  Your art is run out of anything interesting  or new to say.  Right.  The turning point for me around Kanye though was  him lashing out at the Vogue editor.  I would around the same time.  They were on the same time.  They were on the same time.  The one lives matter shirts happened.  I was watching it unfold on Instagram stories.  So I was watching along with Vogue contributing editor,  Gabriella Carifa Johnson, who was at that show in October.  And you know, she said to promote these ideas  and white supremacist ideology on a fashion show  and loop in black people to also promote it.  She's saying is a very scary and dangerous and violent thing.  She was just like, this isn't art, this isn't good art.  And Kanye immediately singled her out.  Mm.  He posted a picture of her.  He mocked her clothes, he mocked her shoes.  I mean, this is someone who has millions and millions  of people following him  and to direct the fire hose of that attention,  at this black woman is a very scary and unsettling thing to do.  And immediately, so many people jump to her defense.  People are posting, talking about her right to express her critique and criticism  as a vocated or a fashion meet that's literally what they're sent there to do.  And what ends up happening is a meeting between all of them as a range  and then Kanye tweets out like, we're good now.  This is my sister.  Yeah.  It's just chaos.  I think what we're, I mean,  I think the other other thing we're talking about  is this other race of people.  What?  They're called famous people.  Oh, yeah.  Famous a race.  Yeah, it is.  It's just, I mean, if, if, if black white, you know,  those are all constructs.  This one is too.  So is fame.  And at some point, I think,  famous people really think that their fame and power  and money you're talking about money,  like money is the thing that undergrad's all this, too.  Yes.  And I think all those things entitled people  to say and do whatever it is they want.  Maybe Kanye isn't black.  Maybe he's just famous.  in his mind.  What do you mean by that?  I mean that the story that it would seem that he can tell himself is that  it's the George Skyler story. It's the Black No More story.  I have moved over it to this other side.  And I think it's pretty great.  Look at me.  I just put a bunch of people in white-lazed matter  t-shirts and sent them out at a fashion show.  Mm.  I mean, what black person would think to do that?  Me.  You and I arrived in strangely different places.  Like the way I'm orienting myself right now  is I'm trying to ask of myself different questions  as a consumer, as a cultural critic, as a thinker.  Like I am really trying to assess what in me  let me overlook those things for so long.  And how can I pay that attention forward?  Who are some of the artist, creators, thinkers,  producers right now who deserve some of that energy, right?  I'm thinking about tems, I finnaf,  I'm thinking of a ton of incredibly talented  black women artists who are coming up right now.  Who are geniuses?  And I'm just trying to do my own reparative work,  and understand how I can do better differently, right?  Because I recognize that I'm part of the economy  that gave Kanye permission for so long.  Because I'm not going to be able to change Kanye.  I can't ask him to show up differently.  I can't even, you know, the only work I can do  is really analyze my own priorities and interests  in curiosities.  I think the thing that has brought us together  to talk about this is not that it is happening or that it is news.  Hmm.  Hmm.  I think the reason that for many of us, the problem presented by this person is personal.  I mean, it's individually personal.  Like the thing about college dropout that so bothered me was that I received it as an indictment,  not actually of getting an education.  I received it as an indictment of getting an education with white people.  He doesn't say any of that on that.  But I went to Yale.  The numbers just made it so that most of my friends were white.  And one of the things that we black people talked about a lot was what it's going to mean  to then have these relationships,  these close friendships with white people.  The fear I felt was that I would get to this school  and get this education,  but that it was gonna cost me something.  And the price was going to be my blackness.  Even though I live a life among white people,  or what people in my life, there have been white people in my bed.  I've never, ever, ever felt in danger of losing my sense of who I am as a black American  person.  But I've always worried.  Yeah.  And wondered, simultaneously, why?  Why am I not making the same choices Kanye West made?  He's got stage four cancer of the thing that I am a hypochondriac about.  You know what I'm thinking of right now?  You know when the walking dead when they go to the CDC?  This is like pretty early on.  It's probably season one.  I'd bear my soul.  You pull out the walking dead.  Okay, but listen, hear me out.  Hear me out.  I'm here.  Okay.  Early on, an AMC is the walking dead.  Someone gets the idea that we should go to the CDC because that's where all the answers  will be.  They make the way there and they realize that the virus that turns people and zombies after  they've been killed is in all of them.  That all of them are actually already infected.  There is no the infected.  and only activates after your debt.  And it's a heart crushing episode  because you realize that the cure they've been looking for  doesn't really seem to exist.  And everyone at any moment has the potential  to become accountable to turn on themselves, really first,  and then everyone else around them.  So I'm listening to talk and I'm thinking about this way  in which this fear that there could be something  latent inside of all of us that turns us unrecognizable.  And that also is related to white supremacy.  We all grew up in this world.  It's all in the water.  And what's between you and me and someone like Kanye  someone like Kanye is mental health issues, right?  A lot of money, a lot of enabling,  and a lot of self-loathing,  and an economy that's not stopping you.  But yeah, the worry that somehow we'll lose track  of ourselves, that's a real fear,  and it's not unfounded.  The fear that I have is that what you so beautifully encapsulated is being a like a latent  possibility in all of us.  It's so depressing and infuriating to watch it proliferate in somebody else.  I mean, we haven't even talked about really the fact that Kanye West is not well and  And no one knows what to do about that unwellness.  And it makes me think about Amy Winehouse.  It makes me think about a certain era of Britney Spears' life when someone's spiral  that feels like it's approaching a death spiral is just tabloid fodder.  There's an attention economy which is why people are talking about divesting from Kanye  and just stopping paying attention.  Stop paying attention.  what I'm also hearing you say is that the real freedom in this scenario is our freedom  to leave him out there.  Yeah.  I mean, it's sad.  It's really, really sad.  And the only power that we have as a society is just to say like, we do not tolerate this.  and we don't condone this and that's where we're at with Kanye.  But I do think that it's not about leaving Kanye.  It's about leaving someone who is completely unwilling to be accountable for the harms they're causing.  And that the only way to inoculate ourselves.  I was thinking about an infection.  From its spreading is to quarantine ourselves.  In herz.  It does.  That's our show.
