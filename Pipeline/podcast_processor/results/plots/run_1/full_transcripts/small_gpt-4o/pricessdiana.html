     Hello, hello, hello and welcome to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English,  the show where you can listen to fascinating stories and learn weird and wonderful things  about the world at the same time as improving your English.  I'm Alastair Budge and today we are going to be talking about the death of Princess  Diana.  It is the story of a princess, the press, the royal family and what people called the utterly  preventable death of a young woman.  Okay then, let's get started and talk about the death of Princess Diana.  In the early hours of Sunday, August 31st 1997, a black Mercedes Benz entered the Pondelenma  underpass, a tunnel under the Seine River in Paris. The car was going fast. With later reports  estimating it was travelling at 105kmh, more than double the tunnel's 50kmh speed limit.  There was a good reason for this, or at least you could understand why the driver was going so fast.  The car was being chased by a reported 30 paparazzi photographers on mopeds and in cars.  Cameras were flashing as the photographers weaved around the car poking their cameras at the tinted  windows, the shutter's clicking non-stop. For inside the car was Diana, Princess of Wales,  the former wife of the heir to the British throne, and almost certainly the most recognizable  woman in the world. Next to her was Dodi Fayet, the son of the Egyptian businessman and owner  of the Harrods department store, Mohammed Al-Fayet. Nobody knows exactly what Diana and Dodi were  talking about on that trip back, but the whole world would know what happened next.  At exactly 23 minutes past 12, shortly after entering the tunnel, the driver lost control  of the car. The Mercedes smashed into another car and then crashed head-on into a pillar.  Neither Dodi nor Diana were wearing a seatbelt. Dodi Fayed was pronounced dead at the scene,  along with the driver, Henri Paul. Diana was still alive, as was the only other occupant  of the car, Dodie's bodyguard, a man called Trevor Rhys-Jones. She was still conscious  and was able to talk to the doctors who were fighting to save her life.  Unfortunately, it was an unwinnable fight. The impact from the crash had been so great  that her heart was pushed out of place, and this tore a pulmonary vein, causing massive internal bleeding.  At four o'clock in the morning, after almost three and a half hours of French doctors fighting to save her life,  Diana, Princess of Wales, the woman many people had thought would become Queen, was pronounced dead.  This much of the story I imagine you will know already,  But what we will do in this episode is try to go a level deeper and unpack what was happening before the crash, the crash itself and its aftermath.  But first, let me give a very brief reminder about the protagonist of our story.  Princess Diana, or Diana Spencer, as she was before she became a princess, was born on July 1st, 1961, to an aristocratic British family.  Her family had extensive ties to the royal family. Diana was a distant cousin of Charles.  Diana's grandmother was friends with Charles's grandmother.  And Diana's family even lived in a large mansion that they rented from Queen Elizabeth.  On the surface, Diana had a very privileged upbringing.  But emotionally, it was not a happy one.  Her mother left her father when she was seven years old,  and Diana would later say that her childhood was very unhappy.  Her family was well known in aristocratic British circles,  but it wasn't until her relationship with Prince Charles  that she truly became a household name across the world.  At the age of 20, she married Prince Charles in a ceremony that was watched by over 750 million people.  It was a spectacle of royal pomp and glamour that made her an icon overnight.  But while her marriage to Prince Charles was made out to be a fairytale for the press and the public,  the reality was quite different. Behind the scenes, the marriage was troubled from the stars,  with the most well-known issue being Charles' ongoing affair with his former lover,  Camilla Parker Bowles, who you might know is now his wife. Diana and Charles separated in 1992,  and would officially divorce four years later, in 1996. In the interests of balance, Diana  also had her own fair share of affairs, but she emerged from the divorce in a much more positive  light than Charles. And she stood on her own two feet. She was a public figure in her own right.  She became deeply involved in humanitarian causes, including raising awareness about  AIDS and campaigning against the use of landmines. She did things that no royal had previously done.  she hugged a man suffering from AIDS, which was hugely important in debunking the myth  that you could catch HIV through physical contact. She walked through a field of live landmines.  She had a warmth, approachability and humanity that no member of the royal family had previously  shown, and you could reasonably argue has shown since. Her warmth and charisma made her the so-called  people's princess, loved by millions around the world. She had this rare ability to connect with  people, particularly the vulnerable and marginalised, and this made her immeasurably popular at home  and abroad. But this popularity came at a price. She was relentlessly pursued by the press  in a way that no royal before and after ever has been.  The tabloids followed her every move, and the public's fascination with her personal  life, her relationships and her charity work was insatiable.  She was constantly hounded by photographers, and the scrutiny was so intense that Diana  publicly spoke out in a TV interview about quite how difficult it was to live under the  media's microscope, and how she felt that she lived in a goldfish bowl. It was this obsession  with photographing her, as we'll come on to talk about in a minute, that some people said ultimately  led to her tragic death. So, what was happening in the lead-up to the crash? Why was Diana in Paris  that night, and what role did the paparazzi play in it all? Diana and Dodie Fayed had only met  six weeks before, but it was a whirlwind romance. They spent the summer of 1997 together,  travelling on Dodie's father's yacht in the Mediterranean, and staying at his family's villa  in the south of France. Although it had only been going on for a few weeks, their relationship  had captured the attention of the press, and speculation was rampant about whether the couple  were about to announce an engagement. On the evening of August the 30th, they ate at the  restaurant of the Ritz Hotel in Paris, which was owned by Dodie's father, Mohammed Al-Fayed.  After dinner, they decided to leave and head back to Dodie's apartment before leaving for  London the following morning. The problem was, as always, the hordes of paparazzi waiting  eagerly outside the hotel, knowing that Diana and Dodie would have to leave eventually.  But Dodie had a plan to throw them off, to trick them. A decoy car was sent to the front  of the Ritz, while Diana and Dodie slipped out through a secret door at the back of  the hotel and into the Mercedes. But the plan didn't work. They were spotted. The paparazzi  were soon on their tail, chasing the car through the streets of Paris. This takes us back to that  tunnel, to the fateful moment when Henri Boil lost control and the car smashed into a pillar.  In the immediate aftermath of the news, there was an almost national sense of bereavement  in the UK. An estimated one million people travelled to London to pay their respects to her,  leaving bouquets of flowers and letters of condolence outside Buckingham Palace and Kensington  Palace, her private residence. The news was full of interviews with members of the public  in tears, people who had never met Diana but felt like they had lost a loved one of their own,  a wife, mother or sister. And Britain isn't known to be a nation of people who are particularly  comfortable with their emotions. You might know the term stiff upper lip, which is this idea that  it is honourable to avoid showing any emotion, even in times of great sadness and despair.  But something was different. There were men, women and children in tears at the loss of this woman  they had never met. Commentators would later point to it as a defining moment in British history,  a time when people in Britain became comfortable with displaying their emotions.  For one family in Britain, however, there was no such emotional awakening.  The Royal Family was staying at Balmoral Castle, its large country estate in Scotland.  There were some token public statements put out in the press, but the Queen and the wider  royal family were criticised for what was interpreted as a cold and emotionless reaction,  especially compared to the outpouring of grief from the general public.  Diana's funeral took place a week after her death on September 6th and was watched  by an estimated 2.5 billion people across the world.  If you were one of them, you might remember that her sons, the then 12 and 15 year old  Harry and William, walked behind the funeral procession, together with Prince Charles,  Prince Philip and Diana's brother, the Earl of Spencer.  The inclusion of the boys in the funeral procession was highly contentious and was criticized  by many as showing an utter lack of compassion. After all, these were two boys who had just  lost their mother and they were being forced to grieve in front of a live crowd of millions  and billions more watching on TV. Unsurprisingly, Prince William would later say that walking  behind his mother's coffin was one of the hardest things that he has ever done. As you  You may remember, the guest list at the funeral service itself was a veritable who's who  of notable figures.  World leaders, past and present, kings and queens, musicians, Hollywood actors and directors,  they had initially been concerns that the funeral shouldn't have been held in Westminster  Abbey, a large cathedral in London, partly because there wouldn't have been enough  guests to fill it.  These concerns were clearly unfounded.  Every seat was filled, and an estimated two and a half million people descended on the  streets of London to pay their respects.  In the weeks and months afterwards, questions started to be asked about who was to blame,  and whether her death could have been prevented.  Was it simply a tragic accident, or were there other forces at play?  Mohammed Al-Fayed, Dodi's father, pointed the finger directly at the royal family and  made the shocking accusation that Diana and his son were murdered in a plot orchestrated  by the British establishment.  Many pointed the finger at Ory Boil, the driver, as tests later revealed he had been drinking  alcohol and he was four times the legal limit.  In other words, he was drunk, he crashed, and that's the end of it.  Others lay the blame squarely with the paparazzi, arguing that their pursuit had forced Ariboil  to drive at reckless speeds to avoid them.  The paparazzi had never given her an inch of privacy, and to her last breath had used  her as a product to squeeze money out of.  And in one final display of the transactional nature of the paparazzi's relationship with  Diana, as she lay dying in the wreckage of the car, instead of trying to help in some  way, or giving the paramedics the privacy to try to save her life, members of the press  jumped onto the roof of the car and continued to take photos of the critically injured woman.  It was the paparazzi that ultimately bore responsibility, so the argument goes.  Now he might have been drunk, but he wouldn't have been driving so fast if the car wasn't  being pursued by the paparazzi.  And this is not just a theory, it's not just someone's argument.  There was a lengthy official inquest into the death, which concluded that, and I'm quoting  directly,  Diana was unlawfully killed by the grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles,  the paparazzi, and of the Mercedes driver Ori Paul. In other words, if she hadn't been  followed by the paparazzi, and if Ori Paul had been sober, she would still be alive today.  And going one level further up, some lay the blame at the feet of the public, the people  who bought the newspapers and magazines that paid the paparazzi for their photos. A single  picture of Diana could go for £500,000, more than a million euros in today's money. So  it's hardly surprising that the paparazzi chased her so relentlessly. It is us, the public,  who must bear some of the responsibility for endlessly buying the magazines with paparazzi  pictures of Diana, and for having such an insatiable appetite to consume every last detail  and picture of the private life of someone who is a vulnerable and lonely woman, struggling  to repair her life after a nasty public divorce.  Now it has been more than 25 years since the events of that fateful evening in Paris.  Her sons have grown up, married and had children of their own.  They both, reportedly, have a visceral, hatred and distrust of the press, especially the  the British tabloid press. And who can blame them? The official verdict was that their  mother's death was unlawfully caused first by the paparazzi. Without the paparazzi, these  two men would still have a mother. Their children would have a grandmother.  To wrap things up, perhaps the question to leave you with is to ask what has been learned  from Diana's tragic death. It highlighted the dark side of fame and the extreme consequences  of a relentless press, but did it change anything? More than 25 years later, her story  still serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost behind the headlines.  Okay then, that is it for today's episode on the death of Princess Diana. I hope it's been an  interesting one and that you've learned something new.  You've been listening to English Learning for Curious Minds by Leonardo English.
